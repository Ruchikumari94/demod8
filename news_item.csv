Prof. Sarkar joined our department on June 16  1958 and retired on 31st October 1992 .      Prof Samir Sarkar was a founder faculty  member of the Department of Chemical Engineering  who initiated the Fuel Technology Section. Prof. Sarkar got his Doctorate from USSR. His familiarity with Russian Scientific equipment helped him to set up a very good Fuel Laboratory.  He built unique experimental facilities for research and teaching  in Coal and solid fuels processing and combustion. He built up a team  to provide  technical backup to conduct high temperature (450 C and above) and high pressure (400 kg/cm^2)  batch or continuous  liquid phase and vapour phase  processes and reactions. He developed the course programs for M.Tech. in  Fuels and Combustion  Diploma program in Combustion Engineering  besides UG courses  in Fuels and energy related subjects. He had guided a good number of projects on Coal processing  Catalyst development for hydrogenation and hydrocracking and chemical additives for liquid fuels. He was a towering figure in his field; Coal  Processing Technology and his name and foot prints could be seen in numerous documents of CSIR  IBS and Ministry of Coal  GOI. In addition to  numerous publications in these areas  he had also written two books:   Design of By-Product Recovery Units  of Coke oven Plant (Translation from Russian  with co-authors I.E.Korabehanku and M.D. Kuznetsov-Asia 1967)   Fuels and Combustion   Orient Longman  (1974  First edition; 1990  Second Edition).   He was an active researcher and dedicated teacher  and stuck to his area of research  even though the then Govt. was de-emphasising coal research due to emergence of strong petroleum lobby at the national level. He had participated actively in the growth of the department  and had established very cordial relations with the faculty and staff of the department. After his retirement he had gone back to Kolkata . Those who had interacted with him closely will always remember him as a distinguished faculty and  wonderful human being.

Mr. V.Vishwanathan  was with the department right from its inception. He had rendered an yeoman service to the department at various phases in its growth. He took charge of the departmental workshop when the department started functioning from the Powai campus. He had managed to put together a make shift workshop in N1 Bay. He had under him a handful of mechanics who had to be trained to undertake the laboratory developmental work and also carry out fabrication of equipment set ups needed for MTech and PhD projects. He was a very good and patient mentor to the staff working under him. He could understand quickly the technical aspects of the equipment needed by the faculty and research students and used his ingenuity in getting the equipment fabricated with the limited resources available at that time. When the department moved to its permanent building in 1962  he had managed to get a fully functional workshop operating on the ground floor of the department. At one point of time he was only person who could operate machines like the lathe and fabricate equipment parts with the  desired precision. He was ever ready to translate his knowledge and skills to others who were working under him. He played a major role in getting the laboratory setups ready in the new departmental building.  Under his motivational leadership  the departmental workshop had at one time got a very good reputation as the place to go when some intricate equipment is to be fabricated. Mr. Vishwanathan's  help was often sought by faculty and research students from other departments also. Mr.Vishwanthan had a very pleasant and calm demeanor and had always adopted a professional approach to tackling all problems which came up from time to time. All those who had the good fortune of interacting  with him would invariably carry memories of his gracious nature and helpful disposition.
