Three important benefits of this workshop may be envisioned. First  it is hoped that the participants will be encouraged to initiate teaching and research in the general area of complex fluids in their respective institutions. Secondly  discussion with the experts could assist in resolving difficulties in an ongoing project. Finally  there will be opportunities to nucleate new research collaborations between the participants and the experts.","meena_m_n","18 Feb 2009 - 10:48","18 Feb 2009 - 10:48","Conference/Symposium","Invited Speakers","Symposium on Rheology of Complex Fluids","IRCC Seminar Hall","21 Feb 2008 - 00:00","22 Feb 2008 - 23:59","185"

Specifically  using  AFM force measurements  we are able to better understand the  interactions between the hierarchical micro- and nanoscale structures on  a mosquito foot and surfaces with different levels of roughness and  wetting properties. We show that the origin of the surface adhesion is  through van der Waals interactions  however  capillary forces can also  contribute to the overall adhesion when the opposing surface is  hydrophilic.  In the second project  I will show how the friction  between an AFM probe and a Au(111) surface under aqueous saline  solutions can be controlled reversibly by the surface electrical  potential.  We attribute this phenomenon to the highly viscous layer  (also referred to as ice-like water) of water that forms at the  electrode/electrolyte interface when anodic potentials are applied   which results in high friction (CoF = 3.1).  However  when cathodic  potentials are applied  the friction is lower (CoF = 0.12). Bio: Dr. Pesika is an Associate Professor in the Chemical and  Biomolecular Engineering department at Tulane University  New Orleans   Louisiana  USA. The overarching theme of his current research is the  development of smart materials; i.e.  materials that have been  judiciously designed (through surface chemistry or topography) to  perform a function when stimulated externally or offer enhanced  properties based on their design. His research group consists primarily  of experimentalists although his approach relies heavily on a  fundamental understanding of the underlying physics before the  development of applied smart materials. Examples of such materials  include biomimetic directional adhesives  anisotropic catalysts with  enhanced catalytic activity  novel oil dispersant formulations which  prevent oil from adhering to marine surfaces  and ultra-low friction  surfaces and lubricants formulations. The projects have been supported  by the National Science Foundation  Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative   and the Louisiana Board of Regents.","webmaster","27 Nov 2017 - 16:09","27 Nov 2017 - 16:13","Seminar/Talk","Prof. Noshir Pesika  Tulane University  USA","Tuning Surface Forces and Interactions – from Mosquito Adhesion  to Reversible Potential Dependent Friction","Room 230  Chemical Engg Dept","30 Nov 2017 - 16:00","30 Nov 2017 - 17:00","185"
3,"2818","Dr. Rahul's Talk","Start: 20 Jan 2011 - 16:00 End: 20 Jan 2011 - 17:30 Abstract: High performance computing (HPC) strategies can today be applied to petroleum-processing problems  including those in the domain of heterogeneous catalysis. Advances in ab-initio quantum chemistry codes (i.e. Density Functional Theory)  and the ability to parallelize calculations over hundreds of CPUs  allow us to evaluate kinetics and thermochemistry for reaction networks of practical interest. The Minimum Energy Pathway can be elucidated and further  calculations of vibrational-frequencies  pre-exponential-factors and entropies can be combined into a detailed microkinetic model. Fundamental chemical-insights into electronic structure  molecular geometry  and the identity of transition-states are also obtainable. The talk illustrates this computational approach using two industrially important problems: Fischer Tropsch Synthesis and bimetallic catalyst design.  Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) is a promising gas-to-liquid (GTL) technology for the production of clean diesel from syngas. In spite of decades of extensive research  there is no consensus about mechanistic details and rate-determining-steps on FTS catalysts (Iron and Cobalt). We clarify the confounding issues using a strategic combination of experiments and modelling. Finally  we demonstrate how quantum-chemical methods can be used to perform systematic screening of bimetallic alloy-catalysts for the rational design of novel  poison-resistant catalysts. In both the problems discussed  the synergy between experimental techniques and computational approaches is the dominant theme.

Energy-integrated networks offer signicant cost ben- ets  however are quite dicult to operate and control due to strong interactions among the individual units and network-level dynamics. Eectively controlling these integrated plants is a critical link to the economic viability  and the energy and environmental sustainability of the chemical and energy supply chains. At the same time  design and scheduling (in the context of batch processes) have strong implications on the controllability and eectiveness of these integrated systems. Using a simple reactor-heat exchanger system as a motivating example  it is shown that the underlying energy ow structure of the integrated networks play a key role in the design of an ecient control system. Specically  in the limiting case of tight energy integration  such networks exhibit dynamic time scale multiplicity and can thus be cast in to a hierarchical control architecture. Considering the batch (operational mode) equivalent of this reactor- heat exchanger system  similar time scale multiplicity is demonstrated; albeit with dierent dynamic characteristics. For both the operational modes  the hierarchical control strategy constructively uses the interacting nature of these systems and helps simplify the underlying control problem. Eectiveness of energy integration in batch processes strongly depends on strict adherence to the designed optimal schedule. In this context  it is essential that the integrated designs are robust to schedule delays. To this end  mixed (combined direct and indirect) integration strategy is used to design robust schedules. An iterative design method is presented to achieve mixed integration which results in improved energy savings while maintaining temperature and time constraints. Ongoing work for improving robustness and handling trade-o between capital and operating cost is highlighted. In a dierent vein  design of integrated networks is approached as an `inverse' of the control problem highlighted earlier. While the control problem requires decomposition of the integrated structure  the design problem aims at combining the prototype structures to obtain desired control properties. Lastly  the interactions in integrated networks are eectively used to obtain optimal schedules. In general  computationally expensive mixed-integer optimization is required to schedule integrated batch systems. In this work  it is shown that the optimal schedules of integrated networks follow specic patterns. These patterns can be used to generate optimal schedules with an order of magnitude reduction in the computational time. Additionally  an interesting relationship between scheduling horizon and storage requirement (design aspect) is highlighted. Overall  the presented work demonstrates that interactions in integrated systems are not always undesirable and can facilitate design  control and scheduling. The developed tools are generic in nature and nd application to a wide range of energy-integrated congurations ranging from conventional systems to emerging technologies. Bio: I received my undergraduate degree (Bachelor of Chemical Engineering) from the Institute of Chemical Technology  Mumbai (formerly UDCT) and my Ph. D. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Minnesota  USA. I am currently working as a DST INSPIRE Assistant Professor in the Chemical Engineering department at the Institute of Chemical Technology. I have close to 10 years of research experience split between industrial R & D and academia. My research aims at developing design  scheduling and advanced control tools for sustainable processes. Specically  I focus on economically attractive (energy) integrated and intensied processes. I was a recipient of Dr. G.P. Kane (Mumbai) University Gold Medal (2006)  presti- gious Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship from the University of Minnesota (2010-11) and Smt. Padma Kelkar Endowment Award for Encouragement to New Chemical Engineering Fac- ulty (2014). My work on control of vapor recompression distillation systems won the best presentation award at the American Control Conference (ACC) at Saint Louis  USA (2009) and the work on the analysis of tightly integrated networks was invited to be delivered as a keynote lecture in Foundations of Computer-Aided Process Design (FOCAPD) conference at Colorado  USA (2009). I intend to build a strong research group focusing on the development of exible (al- lowing for smooth transitions in dynamic market conditions)  optimal (consuming minimum material and energy resources) and resilient (robust to external disturbances and uncertain- ties) sustainable processes. My research will provide fundamental advances to the problems that are at the core of active research in process systems engineering as well as target the design and control problems identied through industry collaborations. My research will also provide a setting for the eective training of undergraduate and graduate students in fundamental research cutting across applied mathematics and control theory.","webmaster","18 May 2016 - 08:00","18 May 2016 - 08:33","Seminar/Talk","Dr. Sujit S Jogwar  Assistant Professor  ICT Mumbai.","Design  Scheduling & Control of Energy-integrated Process Systems","Room 118  Chemical Engineering","26 May 2016 - 17:00","26 May 2016 - 18:00","185"

Garg's Talk","Start: 26 Oct 2017 - 17:00 End: 26 Oct 2017 - 18:00 Title : Simultaneous Production of High Purity Benzene and U.S Grade Gasoline from C6 Heart Cut of FCC Gasoline 1000 Days from Concept to Commissioning. Date & Time : Thursday  October 26 at 5pm  Venue : Room 118  Chemical Engg Dept  Abstract: The MSAT – II regulations active since January 1  2011  restricts the annual average benzene level in Gasoline sold in the USA  (except California) to 0.62 % vol. Currently FCC gasoline comprises  nearly 20 % of the gasoline pool in a typical refinery. Full range FCC  gasoline contains 15-30 vol. % aromatics with around 2 vol. % benzene  and 1000 – 2000 ppm sulfur. A narrow C6 heart cut fraction of the full  range gasoline will   therefore  contain anywhere between 11 – 19 wt. %  benzene and up to 500 ppm sulfur. Unprocessed FCC Gasoline contains  reactive impurities like oxygenates  metals  chlorides  sulphur  compounds  nitrogen compounds  di-olefins and organic peroxides. The  complexity of this feedstock has hindered the development and  commercialization of an economic and reliable process for removal and  recovery of benzene from FCC gasoline. Present day technologies  such  as  hydro-processing (for benzene reduction) result in olefin  saturation  which is undesirable  as it lowers the octane barrels in the  final gasoline pool. Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) produces ~33 000 Tonnes per day of  gasoline from its two world class refineries at Jamnagar  India. The two  world largest 200 000 bpsd FCC units in this refinery produce the FCC  De-Isohexaniser side cut  which is the major contributor of Benzene in  the gasoline pool. It thus seemed imperative to remove benzene from this  stream to meet the above-mentioned benzene limit on the gasoline pool.  Reliance approached us for finding a cost effective scientific solution  to this problem. After establishing the technical feasibility and a  proof of concept  several optimization studies and rigorous  experimentation were carried out leading to the development of first of  its kind for simultaneous production of high purity benzene and U.S  grade gasoline. The process developed serves a dual role of recovering high purity  benzene and producing environmental friendly gasoline from FCC C6 heart  cut stream using extractive distillation without the requirement of any  prior hydrogenation or pre-processing step to saturate di-olefins in  feedstock and reduce impurities. The indigenous technology was granted a  U.S Patent (US. 8722952 B2). A ~0.7 MMTPA (17.4 KBPSD) plant based on  this technology was commissioned in Reliance Industries refinery at  Jamnagar  India in May 2016. A Performance Guarantee Test Run was  conducted by RIL in September 2016 for 72 hours  wherein the unit was  operated at full design throughput. The unit consistently produced a  raffinate product consisting less than 0.2 % benzene and an aromatics  rich extract product with > 97 wt. % benzene along with high recovery (>  99 wt. %) of aromatics in the extract stream. The sulfur content of the  aromatics lean raffinate stream was also observed to be less < 5 ppmw   thus reducing the CAPEX and OPEX of post processing to meet sulfur  specifications. This technology  which has now been proved at a world scale  is now  available for licensing. Huge benefits can be derived by producers who  already have an existing benzene recovery unit  which can be revamped /  optimized at very low cost to process complex feedstocks like FCC  gasoline based on this technology. In the presentation  the author will highlight the extraordinary  journey of this innovative technology development  starting from proof  of concept study to plant commissioning  all accomplished within a  period of 1000 days. It provides valuable insights in understanding the  requirements of the client and to provide a solution based on sound  scientific principles backed up by world class engineering skills.

The strong increase of the viscosity with increasing molar mass is related to entanglement coupling and the presence of a physical entanglement network characterized by an average molar mass between the physical crosslinks  Me  between the macromolecules. But high molar masses are required for materials properties  notably toughness and strength  rendering the production of polymer products an area of unfortunate compromises. Therefore  we designed a novel approach which would enable high molar mass materials to flow better without compromising the properties. The melt viscosity of poly(propylene) is found to reduce dramatically through the addition of a minute amount of silica nanoparticles. We attribute this unique effect to “selective adsorption of high molar mass polymer chains” on the surface of the nanofillers. This represents a paradigm shift regarding commonly-accepted relations between the molar mass and viscosity of molten polymers (Einstein’s equation). This particular rheological behaviour is accompanied by strong effect on the crystallization behaviour during flow. The flow-induced crystallization (FIC) behavior of nanocomposites has been studied using in-situ SAXS and WAXD. The viscosity drop caused by the selective adsorption provides the possibility of creating a more uniform and isotropic morphology in a product. The X-ray scattering study shows that orientation is minimal at 0.5 wt% silica concentration  at which the viscosity also shows a minimum. In comparison to pure PP  the flow-induced crystallization is faster in silica-filled PP  but this enhancement is lowest for the concentration where the orientation is minimal.

Depending on the operating temperature  this can result in freezing of the solvent on a portion of catalyst  rendering that part of the active area ineffective. Freezing can occur by formation of a sharp front or a mush that separates the solid and fluid phases. In function  the electrodes of a battery are very similar to a porous catalyst  and we will analyse the performance of a lead-acid battery at low temperatures that includes the freezing phenomena. Discharge periods of lead-acid batteries are reduced significantly at sub-zero centigrade temperatures. The reduction is more than what can be expected due to decreased rates of various processes caused by a lowering of temperature  and occurs despite the fact that active materials are available for discharge. The major cause for this is the freezing of the electrolyte. The concentration of acid decreases during discharge with a consequent increase in the freezing temperature. Battery freezes when the discharge temperature falls below the freezing temperature. A mathematical model is developed for describing this phenomena. It is argued that freezing begins from the mid-planes of electrodes and proceeds towards the reservoir in-between. Ionic conduction stops when one of the electrodes freezes fully and the time taken to reach that point  namely the discharge period  is calculated. The predictions of the model compare well with observations made at low current density (C/5) and at – 20 ◦C and – 40 ◦C. At higher current densities  diffusional resistances become important and formation of mush further degrades the performance. We also discuss effects of temperature in a model system.

Though distillation is one of the mature technologies  there still remains a lot to be explored with the advent of its variants like Reactive distillation  thermally coupled columns etc. There are growing contributions even on the theoretical front to give better insight and enable easier design of the distillation columns. This 5day course aims to give an overview of all these developments through both theory as well as experiments.    Course Content    The course would start by refreshing the basics of distillation and phase equilibrium  and then concentrate on each of the different distillation types. To start with  the conventional distillation systems with their unique features would be dealt with. Focus would then shift to azeotropic distillation (both homogeneous and heterogeneous)  extractive distillation and Reactive distillation  which are both challenging as well as have novel theoretical tools being developed to understand them better. Few lectures would also address other related issues that are of relevance like HeatIntegrated Distillation Columns (HIDC)  some features of process control of distillation columns  etc.   Experiments to generate VLE data and obtain the interaction parameters using a commercial simulator  and  distillation experiments on a labscale plant will be a part of the course. The ability of a simulator to predict this experimental data using an appropriate model will be demonstrated in the tutorials. Use of tools like conceptual design in obtaining a column sequence  deciding the product purity for a given feed composition  etc. will also be dealt with.

Consequently its production  storage and use have become subjects of intense research. Molecular hydrogen generated by biological means is emerging as one of the sustainable  carbon-neutral alternatives to conventional fossil fuel. Our work focuses on bio-hydrogen production by yanothece  a  group of unicellular cyanobacteria that can fix atmospheric nitrogen. Cyanothece possess both the nitrogenase and hydrogenase enzyme systems implicated in biological hydrogen production.  A two-stage photobiological hydrogen production system was developed for Cyanothece p. ATCC 51142 by employing appropriate physiological perturbations  based on knowledge from prior systems-level studies. Cyanothece 51142 exhibited exceedingly high rates of hydrogen production under aerobic incubation conditions. This is remarkable since most unicellular photosynthetic icrobes entail a complete anaerobic environment for in vivo hydrogen production.  The rates of hydrogen production in Cyanothece were significantly enhanced by growing the cells mixotrophically in the presence of high CO2 or glycerol. Our studies revealed that hydrogen production in this strain is largely mediated by an efficient nitrogenase enzyme system. Addition of glycerol can lead to greatly enhanced nitrogenase activity which is also reflected in the increased abundance of transcripts associated with genes in the nitrogenase cluster. Transcriptomic  comparative genomic and metabolomic studies are being carried out in six additional Cyanothece strains to elucidate the mechanism of hydrogen production in this group of unicellular photosynthetic microbes.

They have been used extensively to compare gene expression profiles between cancer and normal tissues with goals of (1) understanding the molecular etiology of disease and (2) identifying molecular biomarkers for diagnostic purposes. Cancer is a disease of heterogeneous etiology; hence we can expect significant biological variability between cancerous tissue samples from different patients. This can lead to situations where key genes are differentially expressed in only a subset of samples. This is distinct from the case of in vitro biological replicate samples expected to have low variability between replicates. Most currently used microarray data analysis approaches compare mean expression levels between classes and are not geared to find genes whose expression is significantly different in only a subset of samples in a class. This talk will briefly describe available approaches for the identification of such genes and outline a new population proportion ranking method (PPRM) using inter-sample ratios for quantifying variability in samples.

To release hydrogen from these compounds  thermolysis  catalytic hydrolysis  exothermic reactions with solid oxidizers or heat generated by additional reactive mixtures are usually employed. All the current methods have disadvantages which decrease the efficiency of hydrogen storage systems. In the present work  we report new approaches to release hydrogen from SBH or AB  and simultaneously from water  which do not require any catalyst and produce relatively high hydrogen yield and environmentally benign byproducts. One such approach involves metal/water combustion reactions  which provide heat for SBH or AB dehydrogenation and release additional hydrogen from water [1]. The other approach thermally activates AB hydrolysis in aqueous AB solutions under modest inert gas pressure [2]. The investigations include digital video recording  pressure monitoring  thermocouple measurements  gas chromatography  mass spectrometry  powder XRD analysis  NMR spectroscopy and isotopic (deuterium) labeling. The results show that the proposed methods are promising for hydrogen storage involving SBH or AB. The metal/water combustion methods could be used in compact power sources for portable electronic devices  while hydrothermolysis in aqueous AB solutions is attractive for applications where off-board water is used  such as ship propulsion  and vehicle transportation.","meena_m_n","2 Jun 2009 - 17:05","2 Jun 2009 - 17:18","Seminar/Talk"," Arvind Varma R.

In the case of crystalline silicon and its alloys  which are commonly used in the microelectronics industry  nucleation and aggregation of point defects and impurities are responsible for the formation of a wide variety of nano- and microstructures.  While these microstructures often are detrimental to electronic devices  they can also be useful if their formation can be precisely controlled. The aim of my work was to develop a quantitative and mechanistic understanding of atomic scale aggregation processes in solids with emphasis on defect evolution in silicon. In the first part of my talk  I present a multiscale “internally consistent modeling framework” designed to study aggregation in crystalline materials. The key component of this method is a parametrically consistent comparison between atomistic and continuum representation of the aggregation process  in which all parameters needed for the continuum model are derived from the same interatomic potential used to generate the atomistic aggregation data. This consistency allows for the direct probing of the mechanistic accuracy of the continuum rate equations without any ambiguity in the input parameters. The results demonstrate that existing models of vacancy cluster aggregation exclude important dynamic and structural effects that enhance the aggregation rate by providing additional aggregation pathways. In the second part of my talk  I present a new method for extending the scope of molecular dynamics simulations of clustering in crystals. The method is referred to as “Feature Activated Molecular Dynamics” or FAMD. FAMD exploits the local nature of lattice disturbances around certain types of defects and is shown to greatly reduce the computational burden associated with MD simulation of aggregation. The computational cost of this method is shown to scale linearly with the number of defect entities simulated and not with the overall size of the system. The method is shown to be useful in several different applications beyond homogeneous nucleation. The modeling and simulation schemes developed in my work exemplify the growing trend in area of materials research – consistent exchange of mechanistic and parametric information across multiple scales  from nanoscale  to microscale  to macro (process) scale. This approach has led to more fundamental understanding of materials physics along with improved efficiencies in the existing technologies and development of new ones.","meena_m_n","2 Jun 2009 - 17:01","2 Jun 2009 - 17:03","Seminar/Talk","Manish Prasad Ph.D.  University of Pennsylvania","Multi-Scale Modeling and Simulation of Aggregation Processes in Crystalline Semiconductor Materials","Creativity Hall (Room 118)  Chemical Engineering","4 May 2009 - 16:00","4 May 2009 - 17:00","185"

They can accurately capture the underlying transport  chemistry and thermodynamics of many complex physical systems. However  the use of first-principles methods for design is limited by two challenges  which renders these methods computationally intractable - a theme that is found to recur in several systems. The first challenge is overcoming the large separation of length and time scales to reach experimentally meaningful scales  typically ranging from nanometers to centimeters  and picoseconds to minutes. The second challenge is the combinatorial complexity associated with generating structure-property-fabrication phase diagrams for use in rational design of materials. In this talk  I will be presenting a bottom-up multiscale modeling framework  which we have developed recently  to overcome these underlying challenges by deriving a hierarchy of atomistic  mesoscopic and continuum models directly from first-principle methods while retaining the accuracy. Bottom-up multiscale models are extremely useful for chemical engineering design as they can i) provide fundamental insights into key mechanisms at different scales that cannot be modelled with classical continuum equations  ii) help discover new materials for improving the performance and/or reducing cost  and iii) enable the prediction of device performance under different operating conditions and/or at long time scales. The strength of these methods will be highlighted through a specific example of design of self-assembled high-density nanoparticle arrays for catalytic or electronic applications. Current approaches for fabricating high-density nanoparticle arrays rely on trial-and-error. I will present a systematic  rational design strategy that employs bottom-up multiscale models in conjunction with optimal control theory to identify the fabrication conditions that lead to the desired nanoparticle array. Atomistic  coarse-grained and continuum bottom-up multiscale models will be employed to model the self-assembly of the nanoparticles  and to generate a structure-fabrication phase diagram for the nanoparticles array. Use of these methods for rationally designing energy conversion and storage technologies will also be discussed.","meena_m_n","2 Jun 2009 - 17:03","2 Jun 2009 - 17:05","Seminar/Talk","bhijit Chatterjee T-1  Theoretical Division  Los Alamos National Laboratory Los Alamos  New Mexico  USA","Bottom-up Multiscale Modeling based Rational design for chemical engineering applications","Creativity Hall (Room 118)  Chemical Engineering","23 Apr 2009 - 16:00","23 Apr 2009 - 17:00","185"

Utilizing either or both supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) and pressurized water  i.e. subcritical water (sub-H2O)) provides a universal “green” processing platform that is compatible for producing food and nutritional extracts as well as fuel feed stocks such as bioethanol and biomethane.  This lecture will focus primarily on our research utilizing subcritical water in conjunction with SC-CO2 as an additive to change extraction selectivity for solutes and as a catalytic medium to depolymerize carbohydrate-based biopolymers which are constituents of biomass feed stocks. Processing with subcritical water requires a different optimization depending on whether it is to be use as an extraction or reaction solvent.  In this presentation  the following theoretical and experimental optimization studies will be discussed with respect to: 1.  Solvent characteristics of subcritical water as a function of temperature/pressure 2.  Prediction and measurement of solute solubility/miscibility in subcritical water 3.  Correlation of solute- sub-H2O interaction using solubility parameter theory 4.  Solute mass transfer and diffusion in sub-H2O 5.  Importance of sub-H2O space velocity in unit processing 6.  Concurrent extraction – reaction of solutes when utilizing sub-H2O 7.  Dissolved gas (SC-CO2) chemistry in sub-H2O 8.  Tandem and continuous processing using SC-CO2 and sub-H2O  Several examples will be cited for using sub-H2O for the extraction of nutraceutial ingredients  such as natural antioxidants from grape pomace  wood bark  and vitamins from spent brewery’s yeast.  These will include studies initiated with automated pressurized fluid extractors  batch autoclave systems  and continuous flow systems.

The flow dynamics are governed by the continuity and Navier-Stokes equations coupled to a convective diffusion equation for the concentration of the more viscous fluid through a concentration dependent viscosity and density. A generalized linear stability analysis (in which both the spatial wave number and temporal frequency are complex) is carried out in a three-layer flow  which allows the demarcation of the boundaries between convectively and absolutely unstable flows in the space of relevant parameters: the Reynolds and Schmidt numbers  and a viscosity ratio. The flow in the linear regime delineates the presence of convective and absolute instabilities and identifies the vertical gradients of viscosity perturbations as the main destabilizing influence. Our transient numerical simulations demonstrate the development of complex dynamics in the nonlinear regime  characterized by roll-up phenomena and intense convective mixing; these become pronounced with increasing flow rate and viscosity ratio  as well as weak diffusion. A mixed effect of pressure and buoyancy-driven flow in an inclined channel is then studied by direct numerical simulations. The effect of density ratio  Fronde number  and angle of inclination on the propagation of the finger tip and temporal evolution of the mass of cleaned fluid left in the channel are also examined.","meena_m_n","2 Jun 2009 - 16:55","2 Jun 2009 - 16:56","Seminar/Talk","Kirti Chandra Sahu Department of Chemical Engineering  Imperial College London  SW7 2AZ  UK.","Numerical simulations of miscible channel flow with viscosity and density stratifications","Creativity Hall (Room 118)  Chemical Engineering","30 Jan 2009 - 16:00","30 Jan 2009 - 17:00","185"

Research on the design  fabrication and operation of integrated “nanoscale factories”  i.e. processes with unit operations and materials movement among these units at the nanoscale  along with the requisite energy supply system and monitoring and control infrastructure  is lagging seriously behind.  It is progress at this frontier that will enable the research visions of molecular factories  synthetic cells and adaptive devices (e.g. artificial tissues and sensorial systems  nano-system biology for health care and agricultural systems  scalable plasmonic devices  chemico-mechanical processing  targeted cell therapy and nano-devices  human-machine interfaces at the tissue and nervous system level) to become reality. Process Systems Engineering (PSE) as an area of academic chemical engineering research  has effectively solved all the major technological problems associated with simulation  design  control  diagnosis  scheduling and planning of operations for large-scale continuous and batch chemical processes.  As the focus of research moved in scale from cubic meters to cubic millimeters  the design  simulation  control and programmed operation of “plants or labs on a chip” benefited from the accumulated PSE technologies  since the underlying physico-chemical phenomena could still be handled under the same assumption of effective continuous media.   However  integration of functional nanoscale unit operations into a coherent process with specific overall functionality and behavior has not yet started in earnest  and has only been mentioned in passing as a future goal and justification of current research.  With the proposition of “nanoscale factories” as the next frontier of processing scales  PSE must offer new theories and tools to handle the design  simulation  operation and control of active processing systems with the following distinguishing features: (a) The “unit operations” are self-assembled supra-molecular structures at the scale of a few nanometers.  (b) The spatial topology of the “process flowsheets” is guided by molecular scaffolds and the unit operations are positioned in space through directed self-organization mechanisms of independent units.  (c) The operation of such “supramolecular factories” is driven by pre-programmed information encoded in the design of the system itself  and is robustly controllable through local feedback loops with no evidence of centralized coordination mechanisms. In this presentation I will focus on two points:  First  I will offer a series of research propositions that need to be addressed before Nanoscale PSE can tackle the deliberate engineering of living cells or the design of new classes of materials and devices based on active processing systems at the scale of a few nanometers.  Second  I will discuss one specific engineering problem arising from the above  i.e. the construction of nanostructures with desired geometric features  and the design principles and methodologies guiding such a construction.

The biophysical characteristics of OXPLs were investigated using Molecular Dynamics Simulations. The short polar  oxidized acyl chains of OXPLs could reverse orientation in lipid bilayers  thus presenting reactive functional groups to the lipid interface. Such chain reversal is likely to exert a profound influence on the structure and dynamics of biological membranes  and on membrane-associated biological processes.

Venue : Room 240  Chemical Engg. Abstract : I will be talking about concept of Lipid-Biorefinery that I have worked upon and developed along the course of my PhD studies here at Technical University of Denmark. I will be presenting my relevant work done during course of PhD studies in context of the lipid-based biorefinery and its potentials in Indian scenario. The technology that is developed along course of designing lipid-biorefinery during my PhD studies is metabolic engineering of Yeast's lipid biosynthesis pathway to enable it to grow on diverse substrates like sugars  digested starch  digested lignocellulose  crude and pure-glycerol (by-product of biodiesel process) to produce and extracellularly secrete medium-chain fatty acids (C8 to C18) and their derivatives (like mono/di/triglycerides  ethyl-esters  higher chain alcohols  branched fatty acids  dicarboxylic acids  waxes and very-long chain fatty acids  keto acids  ceramides) into growth medium. We did this by downregulating Fatty acid catabolism and upregulating key enzymes involved in anabolic pathway. Engineered yeast ferments these diverse substrates to extracellularly secrete the products described above. Along with lipid-based products of interest  process also produces ethanol which is in itself a valuable byproduct. With slight modifications  there exists possibility of controlling the chain-length of secreted fatty acids or diverting the metabolic flux towards synthesis of other relevant lipid-based compounds. Furthermore  all these lipids are secreted in medium  thus making need for intracellular extraction process redundant. Looking at the larger picture  this concept of Lipid-based biorefinery presents an alluring commercial and scientific potential in India. In terms of diversity of chemicals  Bio-based systems can produce high diversity of carbon-skeleton molecules which can be processed chemically to obtain essential value-added end-commodities (plastics  lubricants  paints and many others). Various prokaryotic organisms including cyanobacteria etc are very promising candidates for development of such biorefineries for sustainable synthesis of value-added compounds along with eukaryotic yeasts that I have personally worked with. Current processes emphasize on obtaining these necessary chemicals from petroleum refinery. Biobased processes provide a robust and sustainable platforms for production of all these chemicals to be used as either fuels or building-block chemicals.","webmaster","20 Jan 2015 - 07:51","20 Jan 2015 - 07:54","Seminar/Talk","Ambareesh Phadnavis  PhD Student Technical University of Denmark.","Lipid-biorefinery - Metabolic engineering of Yeast's lipid biosynthesis pathway.","Room 240  Computer Lab  Chemical Engineering","20 Jan 2015 - 17:00","20 Jan 2015 - 18:00","185"

They can accurately capture the underlying transport  chemistry and thermodynamics of many complex physical systems. However  the use of first-principles methods for design is limited by two challenges  which renders these methods computationally intractable - a theme that is found to recur in several systems. The first challenge is overcoming the large separation of length and time scales to reach experimentally meaningful scales  typically ranging from nanometers to centimeters  and picoseconds to minutes. The second challenge is the combinatorial complexity associated with generating structure-property-fabrication phase diagrams for use in rational design of materials.   In this talk  I will be presenting a bottom-up multiscale modeling framework  which we have developed recently  to overcome these underlying challenges by deriving a hierarchy of atomistic  mesoscopic and continuum models directly from first-principle methods while retaining the accuracy. Bottom-up multiscale models are extremely useful for chemical engineering design as they can i) provide fundamental insights into key mechanisms at different scales that cannot be modelled with classical continuum equations  ii) help discover new materials for improving the performance and/or reducing cost  and iii) enable the prediction of device performance under different operating conditions and/or at long time scales. The strength of these methods will be highlighted through a specific example of design of self-assembled high-density nanoparticle arrays for catalytic or electronic applications. Current approaches for fabricating high-density nanoparticle arrays rely on trial-and-error. I will present a systematic  rational design strategy that employs bottom-up multiscale models in conjunction with optimal control theory to identify the fabrication conditions that lead to the desired nanoparticle array. Atomistic  coarse-grained and continuum bottom-up multiscale models will be employed to model the self-assembly of the nanoparticles  and to generate a structure-fabrication phase diagram for the nanoparticles array. Use of these methods for rationally designing energy conversion and storage technologies will also be discussed.

49,"1211","Multi-Scale Modeling","Start: 4 May 2009 - 16:00 End: 4 May 2009 - 17:00 The design and control of microstructural evolution is the key to the processing of materials ranging from semiconductors to metals to polymers. In the case of crystalline silicon and its alloys  which are commonly used in the microelectronics industry  nucleation and aggregation of point defects and impurities are responsible for the formation of a wide variety of nano- and microstructures. While these microstructures often are detrimental to electronic devices  they can also be useful if their formation can be precisely controlled. The aim of my work was to develop a quantitative and mechanistic understanding of atomic scale aggregation proce-sses in solids with emphasis on defect evolution in silicon. In the first part of my talk  I present a multiscale “internally consistent modeling framework” designed to study aggregation in crystalline materials. The key component of this method is a parametrically consistent comparison between atomistic and continuum representation of the aggregation process  in which all parameters needed for the continuum model are derived from the same interatomic potential used to generate the atomistic aggregation data. This consistency allows for the direct probing of the mechanistic accuracy of the continuum rate equations without any ambiguity in the input parameters. The results demonstrate that existing models of vacancy cluster aggregation exclude important dynamic and structural effects that enhance the aggregation rate by providing additional aggregation pathways.  In the second part of my talk  I present a new method for extending the scope of molecular dynamics simulations of clustering in crystals. The method is referred to as “Feature Activated Molecular Dynamics” or FAMD. FAMD exploits the local nature of lattice disturbances around certain types of defects and is shown to greatly reduce the computational burden associated with MD simulation of aggregation. The computational cost of this method is shown to scale linearly with the number of defect entities simulated and not with the overall size of the system. The method is shown to be useful in several different applications beyond homogeneous nucleation.  The modeling and simulation schemes developed in my work exemplify the growing trend in area of materials research – consistent exchange of mechanistic and parametric information across multiple scales  from nanoscale  to microscale  to macro (process) scale. This approach has led to more fundamental understanding of materials physics along with improved efficiencies in the existing technologies and development of new ones.

This can lead to situations where key genes are differentially expressed in only a subset of samples. This is distinct from the case of in vitro biological replicate samples expected to have low variability between replicates. Most currently used microarray data analysis approaches compare mean expression levels between classes and are not geared to find genes whose expression is significantly different in only a subset of samples in a class. This talk will briefly describe available approaches for the identification of such genes and outline a new population proportion ranking method (PPRM) using inter-sample ratios for quantifying variability in samples.

54,"1927","Dr. Prashant's Talk","Start: 7 Jan 2010 - 16:00 End: 7 Jan 2010 - 17:30 Abstract: This talk is motivated by a long standing problem faced by the FMCG industry wherein highly viscous soils are displaced by a cleaning fluid and also in the oil-and-gas industry wherein oil and gas mixtures are transported via pipelines. Integral to these applications is the formation and growth of waves  the nature of which governs the flow regime and therefore  throughput. In this work  the linear and nonlinear spatio-temporal stability of an interface separating two Newtonian fluids in pressure-driven channel flow at moderate Reynolds numbers is analysed both theoretically and numerically. Inertia  interfacial tension and gravity are also accounted for in the study. In the linear regime  our theoretical (Orr-Sommerfeld-type) analysis reveals that the interface is absolutely unstable over an intermediate range of Reynolds numbers and ratios of the thicknesses of the two layers; convectively unstable regimes are present in the complimentary ranges of these parameters. Increasing the viscosity ratio promotes the absolute nature of the interfacial instability. Results obtained from direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations for long channels elucidate significantly large spatial growth rates in the absolute regime and the nonlinear evolution of the interface which is accompanied by wave coalescence towards the downstream end of the channel.The transition point from a convective to an absolute regime predicted by simulations also agrees well with the theoretical analysis. Bio-sketch: I am a lecturer in chemical engineering at the University of Edinburgh  Scotland. I am based in the Institute for Materials and Processes and my research interests centre around tackling industrial and biological multiphase flows using numerical and theoretical means. These flow problems concern with the environment  energy and the health sectors  which are crucial for our future – some examples being oil-gas flows  industrial cleaning and cancer treatment. A brief summary of my work so far - My PhD  research at Imperial College London dealt with numerical investigation of countercurrent multiphase flows in structured packings. This was followed by my postdoctoral work concerning multiphase flows in oil-gas pipelines and towards minimising environmental footprint in industrial cleaning-in-place processes. My ongoing work at University of Edinburgh focuses on cooling of microelectronic devices and solid-liquid flows in pipelines. My research work at Unilever Research India (prior to my PhD studies at Imperial College London) involved development and processing of novel patented detergent formulations.","soumyakant","4 Jan 2010 - 21:51","4 Jan 2010 - 21:59","Seminar/Talk","Dr. Prashant Valluri  University of Edinburgh  Scotland","Spatiotemporal instabilities in two-phase flows","Room No 118 (Creativity Hall)","7 Jan 2010 - 16:00","7 Jan 2010 - 17:30","185"

I had used it for instructing an elective course last year  and found it useful. But unfortunately I could not arrange for a demo of it to a wider audience.  We now have arranged a demo on Thursday 30 July 4pm-5pm at room #228 (Unless there is a seminar or some other more important event comes up).  I have requested the presenter to be very brief with 15 mins presentation and 30 mins of demo and hands-on for the faculty.  The major points I found about this are:   1. Use of several screens of written material (that can be switched back and forth  instead of erasing and  forgetting)   2. Lecture material on the board is saved (Many times during lecture we come up with a new way to interpret concepts): can be mailed to students or reused/bettered next year.   3. Use of color to hightlight   4. Can be combined with a regular PDF/PPT presentation to use hand marked highlights and explanations on figures or pictures.  It comes with a price though: like any writing practice  as we did in our early school  it takes a while to perfect the handwriting skill.  It is certainly not that bad though; it probably would take about four to five screens of writing to master the basic tools. Patience  is hence called for.

Hence the latex  where dispersing media is water  has become an attractive alternative to the traditional formulations. However  the water-based dispersions suffer with the problem of cracking. It has been observed that while drying  these aqueous dispersions show an intricate pattern of cracks. Further  not only the paints/coatings but the more classical systems such as mud also show this fascinating array of cracks. In the first part of the research work  we have addressed the issue of cracking in drying dispersion. Here  based on the magnitude of compressive strain at the maximum attainable capillary pressure  two distinct regimes for obtaining crack free films have been identified. In the first regime  which we call as Strain-Limited  the maximum crack free thickness (referred to as CCT) decreases with the increase in particle rigidity. In the second regime  which is referred to as Stress-Limited  the CCT increases with the increase in particle rigidity  contrary to the expectations. Film formation in strain-limited regime leads to impermeable films where as the film formation in stress limited regime yields crack free porous films. In the next part  film formation in Latex-Blends has been investigated. These blends are also the water-based dispersions containing soft (low Tg) and hard (high Tg) polymer particles. In these blends  soft particles coalesce to fill the voids and the hard ones give mechanical strength to the final film. Here  an experimental technique to measure the critical stresses in the film has been developed. The effect of various parameters  such as relative volume fraction (soft/hard)  rigidity  etc. on critical stress and film formation has been investigated. An existing model for dispersions with homogenous particles has been extended to blends and compared with extensive experimental data. In the final part of the research work  we have studied the phenomenon of cracking in flocculated dispersions. Here  the critical cracking thickness (CCT) and critical cracking stress (CCS) were measured for aqueous dispersions of  -Alumina over almost the entire range of pH values. We have shown that the theory developed for stable dispersions is equally capable of describing the cracking mechanism in flocculated dispersions as well.

In this talk  I am going to specifically focus on two of the applications of this methodology that I have been involved in.  The first is a biomedical application to study the effects of viral infection on host metabolism. Escherichia coli/MS2 was used as the host-pathogen model system. Coupling experimental studies  with modeling strategies  predictions were made showing upregulation of certain pathways and  downregualtion of other pathways. This illustrates the potential of using this methodology to identify  drug targets. The second application applies to the biofuels area.

The development of a pharmaceutical formulation involves formulation design (e.g. choosing the composition of the powder blend) and process development (e.g. selection of manufacturing processes and equipment) so that the final tablet has the required bioavailability and that the manufacturing processes are robust. The simplest manufacturing process includes a mixing operation and a compaction stage although additional processes are often necessary. In this talk we focus on the scientific challenges involved in the compaction stage. Tablets are made using high speed rotary presses  where one machine can produce in excess of 1 million tablets/hour. The process comprises of filling a die with powder  compaction in a die using rigid punches and ejection from the die  which take place within a few milliseconds. Tablets have tight requirements in terms of bioavailability of drug  weight uniformity  content uniformity  chemical and physical stability  mechanical integrity  etc. The challenges in achieving these quality criteria are discussed while considering that the manufacturing processes must be robust  scaleable  transferable and of low cost. The operation cycle of the rotary tablet press presents a rich range powder flow and densification mechanisms with unique features. Powder flow  for example  has been studied extensively in the context of hopper design  however  in die fill the material is discharged into a closed cavity where the air pressure is increased as more and more material is deposited. Using high speed video we observe and discuss the dynamic processes created by the interplay between the granular skeleton and air for a range of die fill mechanisms characteristic to single station and rotary tablet presses. Then we examine the process of powder compaction from a continuum mechanics point of view. The challenge in this area is to develop appropriate constitutive models that capture the evolution of the material as it is densified from a loose powder state into a dense compact. We present experimental characterisation methods for model calibration as well review the state of the art in modelling of powder compaction. We discuss the implementation of classic incremental plasticity models as well as the development of deformation plasticity models for practical loading cycles. The coupling between the deformation of the powder aggregate and compression of air in the pore space as well as a coupled thermo-mechanical analysis are presented. The application of the models in formulation design and process development is presented using a range of case studies centred on the density distribution in simple and complex solid dosage forms. Finally we discuss strategies for the development of an integrated approach for modelling the full suite of processes involved in tablet manufacturing  such as mixing  granulation  drying  milling  handling  compression  coating and packaging with focus on meeting the required quality attributes of the final product.","soumyakant","19 Aug 2009 - 22:13","19 Aug 2009 - 22:21","Seminar/Talk","Dr. Csaba Sinka University of Leicester  UK","Challenges in pharmaceutical powder processing","Creativity Hall  (Room No. 118)","20 Aug 2009 - 17:00","20 Aug 2009 - 18:30","185"

One of the leading causes of infections is the food-borne pathogen  Salmonella. Once ingested  Salmonella specifically targets epithelial cells in the small intestine for invasion. From the perspective of the bacterium  it is important that the genes responsible for invasion are only expressed at its preferred site of infection. How Salmonella exhibits this control remains an open question. The Salmonella infection process involves three major cellular processes - motility (to reach the site of infection)  invasion (to gain access into host cells)  and adherence (to persist in the small intestine). In this talk  using both experimental and computational approaches  I demonstrate that all three processes are tightly regulated by genetic networks that limit expression only to conditions in small intestine. In addition  the three systems regulate each other to ensure their correct timing of activation during infection  thus  forming a distributed control strategy. This systems-level understanding of the Salmonella infection process is the first to quantitatively determine how multiple factors contribute towards the infection cycle. This research has provided novel insights regarding Salmonella pathogenesis and may discover new targets for antibiotics and vaccines. About the speaker: Supreet Saini received his B.

These oxygenic photosynthetic microbes have long been recognized as cell factories for various kinds of energy-rich biopolymers. These microbes directly utilize solar energy and atmospheric carbon dioxide to produce such compounds and thus provide a source of renewable  sustainable and carbon neutral/negative energy. Microalgae comprises of prokaryotic cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae. Amongst them  eukaryotic microalgae such as Botryococcus  Chlorella  Dunaliella and Nannochloropsis have been identified as outstanding oil producers. On the other hand prokaryotic cyanobacteria such as Synechococcus and Synechocystis are recognized for rapid growth and ease of genetic manipulation of biochemical pathways. In addition to biodiesel  microalgae also hold the potential to serve as a platform for the production of biohydrogen  various sugar polymers and other economically useful chemicals. Although  this concept of microalgal biodiesel production has existed for decades  its commercial exploitation has not been a feasible option so far. Major roadblocks in this endeavor are beginning to be realized. In particular complete genome sequences of many such microbes are becoming available  and advanced transcriptomic  proteomic and metabolomic approaches are opening up the possibility of a complete systems level understanding of energy yielding pathways. Our goal is to utilize these tools to understand and integrate the best of the eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems to turn the microalgal biofuel dream into a reality.

65,"1867","Ujjal Ghosh's Talk","Start: 8 Oct 2009 - 16:00 Recent emphasis on the release of greenhouse gases  and the resulting potential for global warming  has raised concerns over the emission of gases such as CO2. As the political and environmental demand increases  efficient methods for the capture and sequestration of CO2 from the atmosphere will become increasingly important. The most likely options for separation and capture of CO2 from the flue gases of large combustion plants include chemical absorption  physical and chemical adsorption and gas separation membranes. The absorption of carbon dioxide with alkanolamine or potassium carbonate solvents has gained widespread acceptance for the removal of CO2 from natural gas and H2. However  alkanolamine solutions are prone to oxidative degradation at high temperature. The main advantages of potassium carbonate solution for CO2 removal are the high chemical solubility of CO2 in the carbonate/ bicarbonate system  low solvent costs and the low energy requirement for solvent regeneration. The major challenge concerning absorption of CO2 into aqueous solutions of potassium carbonate is a relatively slow rate of reaction in the liquid phase causing low mass transfer rates. It is often advantageous to add a promoter to increase the absorption rate. Absorption of CO2 in a wetted-wall column by aqueous potassium carbonate solution using boric acid as promoter was measured under conditions in which the reaction of CO2 was of pseudo-first order. The overall pseudo-first-order reaction rate constants were determined from the kinetic measurements. The addition of small amounts of boric acid to potassium carbonate resulted in a significant enhancement of CO2 absorption rates. Organic pollutants in wastewater pose a great threat to the environment  as they are carcinogenic in nature. Nitrophenols and chlorophenols are such toxic pollutants responsible for significant health and environmental hazards due to their mutagenic and carcinogenic activities. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and furfural are present in the wastewaters from chemical  petroleum refining and petrochemical industries. Selective removal and recovery of phenolic compounds  NMP and furfural is  therefore  a challenge to those industries. Membrane pervaporation had employed to separate the chlorophenols  nitrophenols  NMP and furfural from their aqueous solutions using synthesized polyurethaneurea membranes.

The geographical extent and adverse effects of fluorosis provide a strong motivation for our work on two aspects: (i) estimation of F– at the field level: a colorimeter had been developed in our group some years ago  but was plagued by problems related to the replication of the device. An accidental observation led to the development of a modified circuit that overcame these problems. The cost of the device is about Rs. 300  and its performance is roughly comparable to that of the conventional uv-visible spectrophotometer; and (ii) defluoridation: the combined process for defluoridation is similar in spirit to the alum-activated alumina process of Mjengera and Mkongo (2003). Water having a fluoride concentration of about 5 mg/L (a value typically encountered in some areas in India affected by fluorosis) can be treated by the present process. However  even after four cycles of regeneration of the alumina pellets  the cost of treatment is high (50 paise/L).

Lithium-ion chemistry has been identified as a preferred candidate for high-power/high-energy secondary batteries. Application of batteries ranges from implantable cardiovascular defibrillators (ICDs) operating at 10 µA current to hybrid vehicles requiring pulses of up to 100 A. Today  the design of these systems have been primarily based on (1) matching the capacity of anode and cathode materials  (2) trial-and-error investigation of thickness  porosity  active material  and additive loading  (3) manufacturing convenience and cost  (4) ideal expected thermal behavior at the system level to handle high  currents  etc.  and (5) detailed microscopic models to understand  optimize  and design these systems by changing one or few parameters at a time. Several problems persist with lithium-ion batteries: capacity fade  underutilization  and thermal runaway caused by operation outside the safe window. Several attempts have been published in literature for circumventing some of above mentioned problems for the lithium ion batteries. Optimal porosity distribution: Improved design A model-based optimization procedure for the design of porous electrodes that are commonly used in advanced batteries such as the lithium-ion system is presented. Unlike the traditional design approach  the proposed approach is based on the simultaneous optimization of multiple variables in porous electrode models to find optimal porosity distributions in porous electrodes. Reformulated model approach: A mathematical model of lithium-ion batteries is reformulated using the various mathematical technique and vast experience of the battery field to reduce the cost of computation. Optimization for improving underutilization: A dynamic optimization especially control vector parameterization procedure is employed for estimating the charging and discharging optimal profile for the lithium-ion battery. Optimal profile for charging and discharging will improve the underutilization of batteries. Kinetic Monte Carlo: Due to various reactions which take place as a part of charging and discharging  various undesirable byproduct forms at the electrode and electrolyte interface. SEI layer forms from this byproduct  which act as the resistance for intercalation of the lithium-ion particles. Large number of literatures are published  to predict the mechanism of formation of SEI layer in parallel direction to the intercalation of lithium-ion. Very meager literature is available which predict the formation SEI layer in tangential direction of the molecule. We proposed to carried out the kinetic Monte Carlo simulation for predicting the formation of SEI layer in tangential directions.

The impact of the basic plantwide regulatory control structure and an explicit supervisory optimizing controller on maximizing the throughput is quantitatively evaluated for a simple process module. The module consists of the reaction A + B --> C occurring in a CSTR followed by a distillation column separating the product from the recycled unreacted reactants. The column vapor boilup hitting a maximum acts as the principal bottleneck constraint limiting the throughput due to column flooding. Through an evaluation of four reasonable plantwide control structures  the location of the throughput manipulator  the composition analyzer for overall component inventory balancing and the local column reflux management policy are shown to significantly affect the maximum throughput. Locating the throughput manipulator close to the bottleneck constraint allows for tighter constraint control using the supervisory optimizing controller minimizing the throughput derating necessary due to disturbances. The effect of the optimizing controller algorithm  PI or DMC  on the throughput derating is also quantified. Control system design for process operation near multiple bottleneck constraints is also demonstrated. Designing the plantwide regulatory control system to minimize the process variability propagated into the principal bottleneck constraint emerges as the key heuristic from the case study.

To understand this observation  adsorption of a model lattice protein on hydrophobic surfaces was studied using Monte Carlo simulations.  It was observed that surfaces with intermediate hydrophobicities can stabilize the secondary structure in adsorbed protein molecules. This happens because an unfolded protein molecule loses conformational freedom upon adsorption  thereby driving the melting point to higher values. However  highly hydrophobic surfaces perturb the secondary structure of the adsorbed proteins. Overall  depending on the magnitude of the surface hydrophobicity  different equilibrium regimes of proteins  namely  aggregated-desorbed; folded-adsorbed; highly aggregated-adsorbed; and weakly aggregated–strongly adsorbed are observed.","soumyakant","25 Nov 2009 - 13:21","25 Nov 2009 - 13:26","Seminar/Talk","Dr. Sumit Sharma","Structure and stability of proteins upon adsorption to hydrophobic surfaces","Room No 118 (Creativity Hall)","27 Nov 2009 - 14:00","27 Nov 2009 - 17:30","185"

Nanoparticles are considered as the building blocks in nanotechnology. Experimental tools play an important role in developing nanoscale science and engineering. These tools bring together researchers from multiple disciplines  e.g.  material scientists  engineers  biologists and chemists  to pursue the common goal of investigating nanoscale phenomena. In the aerosol field  tools have been developed to produce  characterize and manipulate nanoparticles in the diameters ranging from 3 to 500 nm. Several recently developed experimental tools for nanoparticles will be discussed in this presentation. We have developed a nanometer differential mobility analyzer (Nano-DMA) to size/classify nanoparticles with the diameters ranging from 3 to 150 nm. Based on the DMA technique a fast-scan electrical nanoparticle sizer has demonstrated the high resolution and fast response capability to measure bimodal nanoparticle distributions in jet and diesel engine emissions. To enhance the sensitivity of detecting nanoparticles we have designed a high efficiency nanoparticle charger. Further we have investigated a multistage DMA capable of classifying monodisperse particles of different sizes simultaneously. More recently  we have developed a miniature nanoparticle sizer enabling to monitor the nanoparticles in the spatial distribution and at the personal level. Using the particle inertia effect  we have demonstrated the virtual impactor and axial flow cyclone for concentrating and collecting nanoparticles. An electrospray system has been applied to disperse/encapsulate nanoparticles for biomedical  pharmaceutical and toxicity studies. Finally  the development of an electrospray gene transfector illustrates the importance of multidisciplinary approach in nanotechnology.

74,"1919","Talk by Dr Ravi Prakash","Start: 22 Dec 2009 - 16:00 End: 22 Dec 2009 - 17:00 The behaviour of collapsed homopolymers and diblock copolymers subjected to extensional flow is examined using fluctuating hydrodynamic simulations. The copolymer blocks are labeled H and P to represent hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions with the solvent. Collapsed homopolymers are found to undergo a transition in their conformational state from a globular to a stretched state at a critical Weissenberg number. The existence of globule-stretch hysteresis is also demonstrated  with the width of the globule-stretch hysteresis window depending significantly on the quality of the solvent. Diblock copolymers are found to exhibit a fascinatingly complex behaviour in extensional flow. With increasing extension rate  the P block gets fully stretched while the H block remains coiled. Ultimately  a threshold value is reached at which the H block begins to unravel  and the copolymer undergoes a coil-stretch transition. The nature of coil-stretch hysteresis in diblock copolymers is found to be significantly different from the hysteretic behaviour of the each of the blocks that make up the diblock. While de Gennes hypothesis for the existence of coil-stretch hysteresis has been experimentally demonstrated for homopolymers  there has been no experimental observation so far of the existence or otherwise of coil-stretch hysteresis for diblock copolymers in extensional flow.

76,"1929","Dr. Sanket' Talk","Start: 6 Jan 2010 - 15:00 End: 6 Jan 2010 - 16:30 Abstract: Thermo-sensitive hydrogels are a class of stimuli-sensitive hydrogels which can undergo a significant volume transition in response to change in the temperature of the surrounding environment. Most thermo-sensitive hydrogels exhibit a characteristic temperature called Lower Critical Solution Temperature  (LCST) at which they  experience the volume transition. In this work we have studied  a thermo-sensitive hydrogel  poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) that shows an LCST at 32C. The PNIPAM hydrogel is hydrophilic (swollen) below the  LCST (< 32C) while it is hydrophobic (contracted) above the LCST (> 32C). As the LCST of PNIPAM lies close to body temperature  it has great potential as a controlled drug delivery system.  The exact molecular mechanisms that govern the LCST behaviour are not well understood. In the present work we have performed atomistic level Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation of PNIPAM hydrogels mainly to i) Understand the exact origin of the LCST at molecular level ii) Study the effect of LCST on the diffusion coefficient of the solvent (water). A number of computer models of structures of the PNIPAM hydrogels with N N' methylene bisacrylamide (BIS) and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGD)  crosslinkers were generated using the principles of directed self-avoiding  random walk. The structures were further equilibrated using the GROMOS96 force  field followed by insertion of SPC/E water molecules into the simulation cell. MD simulations of a thermo-sensitive hydrogel  PNIPAM  in presence of water were performed below  at and above its LCST (namely  300  305 and 310K) using the GROMOS96 force field.The effect of crosslinking density on the structural and dynamical properties of PNIPAM  across the LCST  was studied using different number of BIS crosslinkers in the model structure of PNIPAM. The MD simulations in NPT ensembles were conducted at 300  305 and 310K. From the analysis of the radial distribution function of key atoms and pore size distribution  it was observed that for all the crosslinking densities the hydrogel structures were contracted at 310K as compared to 300K.  The diffusion coefficients for water were also calculated and it was observed that there was very little effect of the LCST and crosslinking density on the diffusion coefficient of water. Hydrogen bonding interactions between polymer-polymer and water-polymer were also studied. To study the effect of different crosslinkers on the PNIPAM hydrogel structure two different crosslinkers namely  BIS and EGD were used to generate a model structure. The MD simulations were performed in the NPT ensemble at 300  305 and 310K. From an analysis of the radial distribution functions of key atoms  as well as pore size distribution it can be concluded that hydrogel structures for both crosslinkers showed LCST around 305K. The hydrogel structures with both  BIS and EGD  crosslinkers were collapsed at 310K as compared to 300K. Comparing the two crosslinkers  it was observed that the hydrogel structures with EGD crosslinkers were more swollen as compared to BIS crosslinked hydrogels. This is an effect of the longer chain length of EGD  making it swell more than the BIS crosslinker. The diffusion coefficients of water were slightly lower in the presence of EGD crosslinked hydrogel than for the BIS crosslinked hydrogel. This is because the EGD crosslinked hydrogel is more swollen which  inhibits the motion of the water molecules. Hydrogen bonding interactions between polymer-polymer and water-polymer were also studied for both rosslinkers. This study will provide some insight into design of the hydrogels themselves  and how one can manipulate the accessibility of water to the hydrogel as a means of controlling collapse.","soumyakant","5 Jan 2010 - 15:34","5 Jan 2010 - 15:42","Seminar/Talk","Dr. Sanket Deshmukh (PhD Chemical Engineering  University College  Dublin  2009)","Molecular Simulation Studies of Transport in Temperature-Sensitive Hydrogels.","Creativity Hall (Room No 118)","6 Jan 2010 - 15:00","6 Jan 2010 - 16:30","185"

Due to the complexity of multiphase flow and due to the existence of multiple scales it is a formidable task to develop a generic computational algorithm applicable for all the flow configurations. However  multiphase flow can loosely be categorized as i) well dispersed flow and ii) flow with distinct interface. The algorithms are developed for these two typical hydrodynamic situations. Bubbly flow has been taken as the example of well dispersed or mixed flow. A combined two fluid population balance model has been used to simulate the flow. Efforts have been extended for the prediction of transition boundary based on unique transition criteria. Excellent agreement with experiment has been obtained for up and down flow through circular tubes and for up-flow through circular annulus. Lagrangian formulation based Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) has been adopted to simulate the spatio-temporal evolution of interfaces. For the first time the concept of diffuse interface(DI)  has been introduced in SPH. The combined DI-SPH technique has been used to solve a number of problems of bubble and drop dynamics. 1.

In this talk  I will present our experimental as well as numerical results for the steady shape and mobility of viscous drops and bubbles rising in cylindrical and square channels.  The effects of Bond number  Weber number  and the presence of surfactants on the steady shapes and terminal velocities of the drops and bubbles are explored.  As the Bond number increases  drops become more deformed.  At higher Weber numbers  a reentrant cavity is found at the rear of the drop.  Surfactants  when present at low concentrations  retard the motion of the drops by generating Marangoni stresses that oppose the motion of the drops.  When the surfactant concentration is increased  the bubbles can be remobilized.

Moreover  in most instances   these ever-increasing  number of experiments need to be performed using a  limiting amount of  starting biological sample. This requires scaling down of  the analysis  methods and analogous to the integrated microelectronic-chip   revolution  microfluidic chips are starting to transform the field  of  biochemical analysis. Many bio/chemical processes such as mixing   dilution   concentration  transport  separation  and reaction can be  integrated and  automated in a single chip. These devices offer many  advantages over  conventional instruments because of their portability   speed of analysis   potential for multiplexing and high-throughput.   In this talk  I would  present application of microfluidic chips  in two areas--medical diagnostics  and studying cell  signaling. First example involves development of a  point-of-care  device (RapiDx) for detection of disease markers in bodily  fluids  (e.g.  serum and saliva). RapiDx facilitates hands-free analysis by  integrating sample pretreatment (filtering  enrichment  mixing) with electrophoretic immunoassays to quickly measure analyte concentrations  in minimally pretreated serum and saliva samples. The heart of the  device is a  microfluidic chip to carry out rapid immunoassays (<  3-10 minutes) with low  sample volume requirements (10 µL) and  appreciable sensitivity (nM-pM). To  date  we have demonstrated  detection of many clinical analytes including  biomarkers of  periodontal disease in saliva and biotoxins in exogenous serum   samples. We are also developing an integrated microfluidic system  for  real-time interrogation of cells to study intracellular signaling.  Cell  signaling experiments currently are done using large number of  cells and hence   provide population-averaged data that in many  instances may mask the  underlying molecular mechanisms. Our approach  takes advantage of assays  enabled at microscale to provide spatially-  and temporally-resolved  measurement of signaling pathways in single  cells. The integrated microfluidic  platform is capable of  high-throughput acquisition of quantitative protein  expression   translocation and modification information of single and small population of cells. The platform consists of multiple modules such as single-cell array  cell sorter  and phosphoflow chip to provide  confocal  imaging  cell sorting  and flow  ytometry-based  phosphorylation assays.   The modules have been integrated into a  portable package that can be  mounted on a typical inverted microscope.  The icrofluidic platform allows  high-resolution imaging as well as  quantitative proteomic measurements with  high sensitivity (<pM) and  time-resolution (~15 s) in the same population  of cells  a feat not  achievable by current techniques.

This may lead to oversizing or undersizing of a process unit operation  depending on the application and drug product. In this presentation  we provide a rationale for assigning safety factor values based on designing a robust process that allows for scale differences  process variability  data extrapolation  and process expansion.Analysis of a filtration cost model that includes process variability leads to a safety factor definition. Safety factors can vary from 1.2 to 2.5. They depend on the relative costs of failing to process a batch to base case cost  and on the magnitude of process variability. Process models combined with variability data are used to determine the sources and magnitude of process variability. For the typical biopharmaceutical filtration applications  these considerations indicate that process variability generally arises primarily from feedstock  filter variability as well as process operating conditions.The application of the concept is illustrated through a case study for a typical biopharmaceutical filtration unit operation.

In this talk  effect of particle shape on structure  thermodynamics  and surface rheology of two dimensional (2D) suspensions will be discussed. We explore the effect of particle aspect ratio and surface chemistry on particle stabilized ‘Pickering’ emulsions. The results shed some light on the role of surface rheology of the particle film in emulsion stabilization. A part of the talk would also focus on surfactants  which are active ingredients in many personal care products. Self-assembly of surfactants in solutions can lead to a number of structures such as spherical/warm-like micelles  vesicles  planar bilayers. We create metastable nanovesicles and develop a novel methodology to characterize their properties. A combination of techniques (SANS  viscometry  Cryo-TEM  densitometry  DLS  and SAXS) is used to characterize the nanostructure of well-defined surfactant nano-vesicles (~ 15 nm in diameter). The method presented is demonstrated to completely characterize metastable dispersions of paucidisperse nanovesicles  which is of considerable importance in the quantitative estimation of nanovesicle performance in various applications.

The rheological properties of such suspension are influenced by the dynamics and orientation of the suspended particles which is affected by the hydrodynamic interactions. We present the Stokesian Dynamics simulation to study the dynamics of the suspension of anisometric particles by carrying out bounded simulation in homogeneous shear and pressure driven flow. The particles consisted of rigid spheres connected together by strong inter-particle forces. The simulation method was validated by comparing the period of rotation of a single rigid particle with that of the period of Jeffery’s orbit of a spheroid of equivalent aspect ratio. The boundary walls have significant effect on the orientation and dynamics of these particles. Besides determining the shear and normal stresses  we have also studied the velocity and concentration profiles in simple shear as well as pressure driven flow in a channel.

In an isolated system all changes eventually cease when the system attains equilibrium. In a non-adiabatic closed system driving force for change can be maintained using a source of energy that is outside the system. For the earth's biosphere the principal external source of energy is the sun. Energy from the sun is mainly responsible for maintaining driving forces for ecological processes. Only a small fraction of the total energy coming from the sun is being harnessed for the exclusive use of human beings. Is there a limit to how much of this total energy can be appropriated for the exclusive use of human beings? Does this have any implications  technological as well as socio-political  to development?

Exogenous insulin is used to control hyperglycemia in diabetic patients; however  hypoglycemic episodes are unavoidable. Over the last several decades  islet transplantation has been developed as a promising method to achieve stringent control of blood glucose and a potential cure for type 1 diabetes. However  due to the shortage of donor pancreata  alternative sources of islets have been sought through the generation of beta cells from stem cells. Toward that end  embryonic stem cells  adult tissue-residing progenitor cells  and pancreatic duct progenitor cells may serve as sources of islet cell surrogates. Insulin-producing cells generated from stem or progenitor cells display subsets of native islet-cell attributes  indicating the need for further development of methods for differentiation to completely functional islets. The ethical and biological limitations with current sources of stem cells resulted in a quest to look for alternative source of multipotent stem cells of human origin. Post natal tissues/membrane is of interest as a source of cells for regenerative medicine because of its ease of availability  plasticity and inexhaustible source that does not violate the sanctity of independent life. Encapsulation of these islet like cells in Biocompatible capsule for transplantation in diabetic mice is a novelty of this work. Methods: In present study we have established long-term culture of mesenchymal like stem cells derived from full term human amniotic membrane and their differentiation into functional pancreatic lineage. Results: The post natal mesenchymal like stem cells expressed various mesenchymal markers and also demonstrated multilineage differentiation capacity. Further  we observed that these cells can also form islet like clusters (ILC) on exposure to serum free defined media containing specific growth factor and differentiating agents. Differentiated ILCs showed expression of human insulin  glucagon and somatostatin by immunocytochemistry while qRT PCR data demonstrate the expression of insulin  glucagon  somatostatin  ngn3 and isl1. Moreover  encapsulation of the ILCs in polyurethane polyvinylpyrrolidone macrocapsules and their subsequent transplantation in experimental diabetic mice resulted in restoration of normoglycemia indicating their ability to respond to high glucose without immunorejection. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that post natal mesenchymal stem cells can undergo islet neogenesis indicating amnion as an alternative source for obtaining islets for cell replacement therapy in diabetes. Encapsulations of these islets into biocompatible macrocapsule open the new door for preparation of bioartificial pancreas for possible diabetes treatment.","soumyakant","30 Jul 2010 - 20:03","30 Jul 2010 - 20:08","Seminar/Talk","Dr. Sachin S.

We have demonstrated that synthesis of condensation polymers in a hexagonal mesophase results in the formation of rod-like colloidal objects.  As the monomer polymerizes  it swells the hexagonal phase  and as the molecular weight increases  it phase separates. This phase separated object is assembled into a hombohedral object and finally into a rod-like object by matrix mediated nteractions.  I will also discuss assembly of particles in the hexagonal esophase.  We show that the size of the nanoparticulate inclusion  d  in  surfactant mesophase characterized by size  a  determines particle rganization in the mesophase. Small particles  viz.d < a  are templated y the mesophase  while for d ~ a  there is a coexistence between a  ispersed particle phase and string like particle aggregates. For d > a  the particles organize into networks of string-like aggregates. This behaviour is generic  independent of the particle surface chemistry. We show the formation of networks of inorganic oxides  metals  proteins and polymer hydrogels in hexagonal mesophases.

UV transparent pyrex incorporated into a silicon microreactor simplified UV microreactor fabrication as compared to earlier reports and enabled higher temperature and pressures to be used. The devices so formed were validated using low pressure (0.8 W) Hg vapor lamps to carry out benchmark intra and intermolecular addition reactions. To increase yields  a setup incorporating high pressure Hg vapor lamps (1 kW) was developed. The high heat output from these lamps presented unique design challenges and these were overcome using appropriate cooling techniques. High pressure capillary mercury lamps in conjunction with silicon based microchannel reactors allow photochemical reactions to proceed under residence times as low as 1 minute. Design and fabrication of the reactor system will be described along with preliminary results that highlight its utility as a synthesis tool. Quantum efficiency for the addition of methanol to limonene was found to be 0.2  emphasizing improvements over traditional reactor configurations. The performance of low and high pressure lamps for a given reaction will be compared and the increase in throughput on account of the high pressure lamps highlighted. Integration with an automated synthesis platform to allow high efficiency reaction screening will be described. Implementation of continuous manufacturing for direct fluorination and melt processing reactions will be discussed.

The suspensions are comprised of silica colloids  45 nm in diameter  coated with octadecyl-hydrocarbon chains in decalin at colloidal volume fractions ranging from 0.20 to 0.43.  During gel formation  the suspensions acquire a shear modulus that increases with time  while the thermal motion of the colloids becomes localized over an increasingly restricted range. The nanometer-scale localization length characterizing this motion obeys an exact relationship with the shear modulus predicted  heoretically from mode coupling calculations (K. S. Schweizer and G. Yatsenko  J. Chem. Phys. 127  164505  2007). This scaling thus demonstrates a direct quantitative connection between the microscopic dynamics and macroscopic rheology. It further indicates the importance of local structure over longer-range correlations in dictating the dynamical and mechanical properties of such gels.  I will conclude the seminar with a brief overview of research in my group and highlight another project which has been of considerable interest in the last couple of years - in developing a continuous enzymatic process to convert cellulosic biomass to biofuels.

We will describe the effect of interfacial modifiers on the structure and flow properties of polymer blends.  We will also discuss attempts to transplant existing strategies of structure control from small-molecule two-phase systems  e.g. mayonnaise  to immiscible polymer blends. As a first example of interfacial modifiers we will consider block copolymers  which are often used to promote blending of immiscible polymers.  Experiments show significant rheological consequences due to added diblock copolymer e.g. as little as 0.1 wt.% copolymer can double the blend viscosity.  Such large rheological effects are attributable to interfacial immobilization induced by the added copolymer.  Interfacial immobilization can also explain why the copolymer can suppress coalescence in some cases.  In such cases  we can transplant methods of structure control in oil/water emulsions to polymer blends. As a second example of interfacial modifiers  we will consider non-amphiphilic particles which adsorb at the interface between immiscible polymers.  Once again  analogous to research in oil/water systems  such particles can stabilize polymer blends and foams.  Furthermore  anisotropic morphologies can be realized by interfacial “jamming”  i.e. tightly covering interfaces with particles so that the interface cannot relax into an isotropic morphology. In summary  even small amounts of interfacial modifiers  combined with a suitable processing history  can effect large changes in the morphology of polymer blends.","soumyakant","16 Aug 2010 - 09:52","16 Aug 2010 - 09:56","Seminar/Talk","Dr. Sachin Velankar  Dept. of Chemical Engineering University of Pittsburgh","Interfacial phenomena and structure control in immiscible polymer blends: Applying insights from oil/water systems.","Creativity Hall (Room No. 118)","19 Aug 2010 - 16:00","19 Aug 2010 - 17:30","185"

We present results of recent calculations on some real systems as well as some preliminary studies on model bead-spring chains (homopolymers).   The principal components of the optical  polarizability tensor  the number and dihedral angle values of the conformational states at single bond and at two successive bonds  have been varied in order to mimic a wider range of conditions as compared to our earlier studies.   The longer term plan via generalized simulations using is to map homopolymers  copolymers (via Monte Carlo) such as alternating and statistically random  graft copolymers including side-chains (groups). We present our recent work in looking at aggregation and adsorption of polymers and surfactants in solution containing solid surfaces  using Lattice Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble.  The effect of intermolecular energies for surfactant head-group  tails and polymer chain  have been studied at different levels of overall solutionconcentration in this investigation using a model system. We present our recent work in which we have devised a simple new method to predict the optical birefringence on polymer surfaces via molecular simulations.  The approach was implemented for first to amorphous polyethylene and polyethylene oxide melts as classical examples using united-atom and atomistic model descriptions  via Configurational-Bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) simulations.

In this talk I will present our work on advancing our knowledge of dynamics and thermodynamics at small scales and interfaces  and  relevance to potential applications in geology  biology  and  emerging technology. Confined /interfacial systems are distinct from the bulk systems in two key ways. Firstly  at least one dimension in the microscopic regime means mixing is diffusion limited (Reynolds number <<1). Secondly  a large surface to volume ratio implies that surface-fluid interactions play a dominant role in structuring of fluid at the interface. Using molecular simulations and liquid state theory  we first show that this resulting fluid structure is intimately related to both the thermodynamics and dynamics of the fluid for systems ranging from a confined hard-sphere fluid  a protein in an aqueous medium  and  a silicate melt at geologically relevant conditions. We then exploit this structural-thermodynamical-dynamical coupling of fluid properties to predict as well as systematically tune these properties of aforementioned fluid systems by varying the underlying interactions in the system. We discuss how these results can be used in the laboratory or industry to optimize the conditions for folding of proteins  to extrapolate the dynamical data obtained for silicate melts  and  to get particle-surface interactions which either speed up or slow down the diffusive motion in colloidal fluid About the speaker: Gaurav Goel is a postdoctoral scholar in the groups of Profs.

The reason for that was mostly the lack of suitable instrumentation and methodologies. However  recent developments in high-resolution scanning electron microscopes (HR-SEMs) and cryo-systems for those have made them ideal tools for the study of nanoparticles and colloids in viscous systems  or systems containing large objects (hundreds of nanometers and larger)  in which small (nanometric) features are to be imaged. At the Technion we have recently made substantial progress in the cryo-SEM methodology  allowing us to image liquid and semi-liquid systems at their native state. In addition we have continuously advanced our cryo-TEM methodology.

Amphiphilic molecules  such as block copolymers and surfactants  exhibit rich phase behavior and have been used extensively as excellent templates for highly ordered nanostructure materials with various architectures. Therefore  utilization of the rich phase behavior of amphiphilic molecules may provide a general and inexpensive way for fabricating a large variety of self-assembled and highly ordered arrays of 1D nanoparticles without going through complicated preparative procedures. In this talk  two examples of recent studies in this direction will be presented. The first example is thermally switchable 1D and 2D arrays of individually isolated single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) using cooperative self-assembly of functionalized SWNTs and a block copolymer/water system. The second example is a new phase diagram of negatively charged 1D nanoparticle and cationic liposome complexes in water that exhibit three different highly ordered phases  intercalated lamellar  doubly intercalated lamellar  and centered rectangular phases.

This flexible system can also go awry  and autoimmune diseases result from the adaptive immune system failing to discriminate between markers of self and non-self.  Adaptive immune responses are orchestrated by T lymphocytes (T cells).  The immune response results from cooperative dynamic processes with many participating components that must act collectively for a phenomenon to emerge.  Moreover  these processes are stochastic and span multiple spatio-temporal scales.  I will describe our work on T cell biology that brings together theoretical and computational studies (rooted in statistical physics and engineering kinetics) with experiments carried out by key collaborators (immunologists at medical schools) to shed light on the mechanisms underlying these complex multi-scale processes.

In dilute (<0.1 M) salt solutions  ion-protein interactions are thought to be governed predominantly by non-specific electrostatic screening. However  using first-principles based charge and calorimetric measurements  we provide direct evidence for preferential and selective accumulation of anions at the protein surface even under dilute salt conditions. Employing this framework and several case studies  we show that seemingly different manifestations of protein insolubility  reversible self-association  and aggregation can be caused by similar underlying ion-protein interactions.

Over the past ten years  enormous improvements in technological capabilities and theoretical understanding have occurred  and approaches that once relied heavily on empirical observations and intuition are gradually yielding to those more firmly grounded in theory and supported by more methodologically sophisticated implementation and analysis. Over  the same time  the important relationship between process engineering requirements and metabolic engineering approaches has become even clearer as additional projects have come close to or achieved commercial application.  Early interactions between metabolic and process engineers have been routinely shown to be most important in specifying the key deliverables that are needed from the metabolic engineering program. In effect  process engineers and metabolic engineers  working together from the beginning of a project and sharing with each other the perspectives and limitations inherent in their disciplines  can find the optimal path to a solution which capitalizes on the strengths of each. In this presentation  I will discuss metabolic engineering activities that have been underway at DuPont in recent years  from further refinement of technology for the fermentative production of 1 3-propanediol from sugars  to the elaboration of metabolic approaches for the production of long chain omega-3 fatty acids  the production of fuels from lignocellulosic starting materials  and the production of novel fuels such as iso-butanol. This is a diverse set of applications of metabolic engineering  and each of these programs has an abundance of particular  idiosyncratic needs defined by the product  choice of organism  and commercial value proposition – some determined by process engineering realities and some determined by metabolic engineering realities.  However  despite the enormous variation  these programs also share important focusing features. It is hoped that the comparison and contrast will shed light on the state of metabolic engineering for the production of industrial products  and provide useful perspective for further improvements.

Polymeric additives are used in inks  agricultural sprays etc. to control undesirable splattering of drops and jets into tiny droplets. Individual polymer molecules stretch during flow to confer a spring-like elasticity to slender filaments of polymer solutions. However  the dynamics of such filaments are not well understood. A curious observation is that solutions that are supposed to be dilute  behave as if they are quite concentrated when stretched into filaments.  This self-concentrating behaviour further enables thin filaments to resist the crushing grip of surface-tension for much longer than expected. In this talk  I will try to show why this is so.","webmaster","1 Mar 2011 - 13:55","1 Mar 2011 - 14:00","Seminar/Talk"," Prof. R.

It is also true that peace and tranquility usher great progress in the arts and sciences. One might conclude that consensual and just resolution of conflicts is the necessary condition for a society to significantly improve its condition. Consensus can only be possible on the basis of shared and enduring values. These ideas are of general applicability  and in particular to educational institutions as well. In the mature phase of his career  Professor Kartic Khilar strived towards institution building. In this lecture  I raise issues of relevance to this interest of his. I identify a few points of conflict IITs encounter. One is with the Government of India which is a legitimate stakeholder but whose policies do create a conflict of quality versus quantity. Then there are contradictions between statutory and idealized goals and reality conditioned and imposed by the embedding society.  IIT has become a brand name and public expectations of the product can and do interfere with educational objectives. It would be unwise to think that extrication from conflicts can be assured  but I do hope  and hope lies in seeing possibilities  to overcome fears created by these conflicts.

Thin film composite (TFC) reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes have been widely applied not only to seawater desalination but also to brackish water desalination and industrial and waste water treatment. TFC membrane is produced by in-situ interfacial polycondensation (IP) reaction between monomeric polyamine (m-phenylene diamine  MPD) and polyfunctional acid halide (trimesoyal chloride  TMC) on finely porous base membranes to deposit a thin film barrier layer  whose properties determine the desalination performance of the membrane. In this study  we first determine the optimum window of MPD and TMC concentration with water flux and salt rejection as target variables. For this purpose  we conduct TFCM   synthesis experiments with aqueous and organic phase monomer concentration each at five different concentration levels. Flux and rejection data obtained were statistically analysed to study the effect of individual concentration  its interaction and experimental error. The effect of MPD and TMC on flux and rejection were correlated with measured membrane properties.  Using optimum concentration window of MPD and TMC  different thin film composite and nanocomposite (TFNC) membranes were prepared by incorporation of additives and nanoparticles to identify promising recipes. New methods have been developed to measure thickness of the thin polyamide layer using AFM and profilometry. Advantage of this method is that it is very simple compare to TEM technique which require high expertise in sample preparation and microtoming. To correlate IP reaction kinetics with TFCM’s structue and properties new method have been identified to study the kinetics of IP reaction.

Uncontrolled or accidental discharges of chlorinated solvents into the subsurface have led to extensive contamination of groundwater aquifers. Chlorinated solvents are extremely toxic and even trace quantities in the groundwater render the water unsafe for use. To date  remediation efforts to restore groundwater to meet drinking water standards have not been successful at any large chlorinated solvent-contaminated site and thus there is an urgent need for development of new  effective remediation technologies. Nanoparticles of zero valent iron (NZVI) can degrade chlorinated organic compounds very rapidly to innocuous products such as ethane and chloride ions. This makes NZVI an excellent reactant for cleaning up chlorinated solvent-contaminated sites. Recent studies have however shown that bare NZVI when injected into the ground through wells  are able to migrate only a few feet from the wells because they get filtered out by the soil. This result is not intuitive  given that a large fraction of the pores in subsurface granular media are much larger than the nanoparticles. Modifying the surfaces of NZVI with polymers  however  shows significantly improved mobility in groundwater. The presentation will discuss the characteristics of polymer-stabilized NZVI that enhance it transport in subsurface porous media. Results from controlled laboratory studies will show how NZVI surface characteristics  aqueous solution chemistry  sand grain characteristics  influences the mobility of polymer-stabilized NZVI. Given the high mobility of polymer-stabilized NZVI  the remaining challenges and opportunities for NZVI-based remediation technologies for groundwater remediation will be discussed.

Although it occurs at all length scales  self-assembly of colloids is particularly interesting because the interactions between colloids can be quite easily tuned to direct self-assembly into desired target structures. Despite a myriad of experiments have been reported  several aspects such as mechanism  kinetics and thermodynamic stability of the self-assembled structures are not understood adequately. We use analytical and stochastic modeling approaches and computer simulations to address some of these aspects. In this talk  I will discuss the molecular origin of self-assembly of two different kinds of patchy colloids: polyoxometalates (a kind of inorganic macromolecule) and apoferritin (a type of protein molecule). I will also discuss the stability of hollow shells formed by nanoparticles that interact via competing interactions  and a theoretical framework to explain how the shell size is varied using certain experimental parameters. Finally  I will discuss the mechanism and kinetics of self-assembly of nanoparticles into nanorods  and the formation of nanoparticles inside reverse micelles using timescale analysis and population balance equations. *Biography* Ethayaraja Mani obtained his B.Tech degree in chemical engineering from Coimbatore Institute of Technology in 2003.

High equipment density coupled with storage under pressure and many potential leakage and ignition sources contribute to a high explosion risk. Serious accidents that have occurred both offshore and onshore in the past demonstrate the necessity of this strong emphasis on safety. The seminar starts by briefly discussing the combustion mechanisms important during explosions and the factors affecting these mechanisms. The necessity of using CFD for prediction of the consequences of explosions occurring in a process facility is then established. The models included in CFD tool FLACS that has been specifically developed for this purpose are described. Extensive modelling and validation work has recently been carried out to make FLACS a more reliable tool for hydrogen safety applications. This is driven by the expectation that hydrogen can become an important energy carrier in the future. In general  hydrogen is much more explosive than e.g. gasoline. But hydrogen also has some positive qualities such as very large buoyancy that can minimize the risk of a spill. It is therefore important to develop good tools for calculating the consequences of possible accidents. The study treats release  dispersion  combustion and explosion of hydrogen and development of risk analysis methods. Some examples and approaches of how this tool is applied for performing explosion safety assessments for process facilities are also presented.","webmaster","11 Jun 2011 - 11:07","11 Jun 2011 - 11:12","Seminar/Talk","Dr Prankul Middha  GexCon AS  Bergen  Norway","The use of CFD for explosion safety studies on process facilities","Dept Library (Skype)","14 Jun 2011 - 11:30","14 Jun 2011 - 11:30","185"

Low energy and bulk densities  seasonal availability and distributed supply create unique challenges that must be e®ectively addressed. The determination of the techno-economic feasibility of this system in the presence of existing and novel technologies is non-trivial. Moreover  it must be ensured that the development and functioning of the feedstock production system is sustainable and resilient. This work takes a systems theory based approach to address these challenges through the development of optimization and agent-based simulation models. An optimization based decision making framework named BioFeed has been developed to optimize the local/regional feedstock production system. A unique feature of this mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is the integration of the design as well as operational decisions in a single framework. The model also identi¯es system bottlenecks and quanti¯es the systemic impacts of technology improvement. The model was successfully used to study the production of switchgrass and Miscanthus in Illinois (US). The results indicated that the choice of biomass pre-processing technology signi¯cantly a®ected the total cost  which varied between 45-65$/Mg. This translated to about 50% of the targeted ethanol production cost of 0.32$/l. Biomass pre-processing  such as grinding  and storage were the major cost components. Sensitivity analysis showed that 25% increase in pre-processing throughput rate led to 10% reduction in the total cost and energy consumption. A novel computational scheme combining mathematical programming and agent-based modeling was developed  which resulted in an order of magnitude reduction in the simulation time. Moreover  the optimal solution was within 5% of the rigorous MILP solution. Large scale production of ligno-cellulosic feedstock is not yet established  and there is a signi¯cant lack of understanding about the development and functioning of such as system. It is a complex system with multiple scales  uncertainties and emergent properties. An agent-based model was therefore developed using the theory of complex adaptive systems to study its dynamics. Important stakeholders such as biore¯nery and farmers were modeled as independent agents using an object-oriented approach. Simulation results for Miscanthus production showed that up to 15 years might be required to reach steady regional biomass productivity  which has implications on biore¯nery capacity planning. The contract price could be up to 40% higher than the optimized production cost. The model will be used in future to study the resiliency of this system in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances in the future.","webmaster","11 Jun 2011 - 11:13","11 Jun 2011 - 11:17","Seminar/Talk","Dr. Yogendra Shastri  Visiting Research Assistant Professor Energy Biosciences Institute & Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","Techno-economic feasibility analysis of bioenergy feedstock production using optimization and simulation models","Dept Library (Skype)","14 Jun 2011 - 09:30","14 Jun 2011 - 11:30","185"

Through the careful integration of soft materials and chemistry  researchers have recently devised chemo-responsive polymer gels that autonomously oscillate in the absence of any external stimuli. The soft polymeric material of the gel allows it to bend  stretch and change its shape in a manner analogous to living creatures. The chemistry  on the other hand  makes these gels self-powered by virtue of the oscillatory Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) chemical reaction. Driven by the periodic oxidation and reduction of the ruthenium (Ru) catalyst  which is grafted to the polymer network  these BZ gels swell and de-swell and thereby  transduce chemical energy into mechanical response. The BZ reaction  however  is photo-sensitive with light of a certain wavelength suppressing the oscillations within the gel. We demonstrate that the interplay between the chemo-responsive gels and the photosensitive reaction can cause mm sized BZ gels to exhibit autonomous  directed motion or reorientation away from the light. Through the use of our recently developed three-dimensional gel lattice spring model we show that these synthetic BZ “worms” display a fundamental biomimetic behavior: movement away from an adverse environmental condition  which in the context of the BZ reaction is the presence of light. Furthermore  we exploit this property to control the self-sustained motion of macroscopic BZ gel “worms”. By tailoring the arrangement of illuminated and non-illuminated regions  we direct the movement of these worms along complex paths  guiding them to bend  reorient and turn. In particular  these gels can make both 900 and U-turns. Moreover  the path and the direction of the gel’s motion can be dynamically and remotely reconfigured (as opposed to being fixed  for example  by a pattern on an underlying surface). We also perform stability analysis to establish broad guidelines that would yield the desired motion of the gel. Our findings can be utilized to design intelligent  autonomously moving “soft robots” that can be reprogrammed “on demand” to move to a specific target location and to remain at this location for a chosen period of time.","webmaster","11 Jun 2011 - 11:18","11 Jun 2011 - 11:22","Seminar/Talk","Dr Pratyush Dayal   Department of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering  University of Pittsburgh","Modeling active self-oscillating gels that follow complex paths","Dept Library (Skype)","15 Jun 2011 - 00:30","15 Jun 2011 - 11:30","185"

However  use of exotic and expensive platinum as the electrocatalyst poses serious problems for commercial viability. In this regard  there is an urgent need to develop low-platinum or non-platinum electrocatalysts with electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) superior or comparable to that of platinum. Among non platinum electrocatalysts  palladium-based electrocatalysts  particularly  Pd-M (M = Mo and W) alloys were synthesized and investigated for their activities towards ORR. Rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements reveal that the alloying of Pd with Mo or W significantly enhances the catalytic activity for ORR as well as the stability (durability) of the electrocatalysts. Additionally  both the alloy systems exhibit high tolerance to methanol  which is particularly advantageous for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC). One of the key strategies for low platinum electrocatalyst is to selectively deposit platinum on the surface of other base metals. Regarding that  novel carbon-supported binary Pt@Cu “core-shell” nanoparticles have been synthesized by galvanic displacement of Cu by Pt4+ ions at ambient conditions. Structural characterizations suggest that the Pt@Cu nanoparticles have a Pt-Cu alloy layer sandwiched between a Cu core and a Pt shell. The electrochemical data clearly point to an enhancement in the activity for ORR for the Pt@Cu “core-shell” nanoparticle electrocatalysts compared to the commercial Pt electrocatalyst  both on per unit mass of Pt and per unit active surface area basis. The trend in activity also indicates that the electrocatalytic activity of platinum can be increased by changing the core composition. A large class of non noble metal  transition metal oxide electrocatalysts show good activity for ORR in alkaline conditions. Lanthanum based perovskites and lithiated nickel oxide have been investigated for ORR and the electrochemical activity have been found to be comparable to that of platinum. These oxide electrocatalysts are promising for recently developed alkaline exchange membrane fuel cells. However  the alkaline exchange membranes suffer from low ionic conductivity and stability at high temperatures. The main reason of degradation is the attack by poorly solvated OH- to the tetraalkylammonium headgroups especially at high temperature. Model room temperature ionic liquids such as tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide (TEOH) and TEOH-imidazole/triazole blends have been investigated and the results  ndicate that solvation of OH- by imidazole/triazole prevents the deteioriation of tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide.","webmaster","11 Jun 2011 - 11:35","11 Jun 2011 - 11:40","Seminar/Talk","Dr. Arindam Sarkar  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory  CA","Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction on non platinum  low platinum and non noble metal electrocatalyst.","Dept Library (Skype)","15 Jun 2011 - 11:30","15 Jun 2011 - 13:00","185"

Particulate flows are prevalent across a diverse range of industrial and geophysical processes. Examples include pharmaceutical processes  conveying lines for transporting minerals  ores  food and agricultural products  fluidized bed reactors  debris flows  and sediment transport. Despite recent advances owing to computer simulations  particulate flow processes remain poorly understood. Understanding the physics of particulate flows can lead to avoiding problems before they occur and increase the efficiency of transport processes significantly. In this talk  I will discuss two specific applications of the particulate flow modeling (1) discharge and segregation of granular materials in hopper flows and (2) erosion and transport of lunar regolith (soil) due to impingement by rocket exhaust plume during landing of spacecrafts. The first application investigates hopper discharge phenomenon from a quasi-3D  rectangular hopper using the Discrete Element Method (DEM - each individual constituent particle is modeled separately and hence called discrete). Hoppers are widely used in industries to store and transfer granular materials. Two industrially relevant quantities are explored: (1) Discharge rate and (2) extent of discharge segregation from the hopper. A pendular liquid bridge force model describes the cohesion between the particles and the Bond number (ratio of cohesive force and gravitational force on a particle) characterizes the strength of the cohesive bond. For both cohesive and cohesionless granular media  the effects of particle properties and hopper geometry on discharge rate are studied through DEM and compared to previously published experimental correlations. A modified correlation for discharge rate is developed for cohesive materials from cohesionless materials. In addition  a bi-disperse granular material flowing from a 3-D hopper is simulated using DEM for cohesive particles and the extent of discharge segregation is characterized over time. The second application of particulate simulations pertains to the entrainment of lunar regolith (soil) by the supersonic plume of a landing rocket. This entrainment is often problematic due to scouring and dust-impregnation of surrounding hardware  reduction in visibility for the crew  and spoofing of the landing sensors. Hence  it is extremely important to predict the erosion dynamics of regolith to both assess and reduce the problem.  In the present work  the parameters affecting the erosion rate are investigated using DEM. The flow of exhaust rocket plume has been studied using CFD at NASA and the results have been incorporated into this work. The results indicate that DEM simulations are capable of reproducing trends in the erosion rate that are known through other investigations and in addition give valuable insight into the significance of inter-particle collisions on the erosion rate.  The latter is particularly important as it appears to gives rise to the phenomenon like instability in the erosion process and particle sedimentation which cannot be explained without taking into account the inter particle collisions.

As petroleum prices continue to rise and the manufacturing industry gradually shifts to the middle-east the Indian plastic industry is bound to make a strategic shift to the production of specialty plastics. Additionally  as demands on cleaner environment and sustainability increase the Indian plastics industry will have to focus on the production and processing of environmentally benign polymers. Development of such plastics requires a deeper understanding of the intricate relations between the structure and topology of macromolecules and their processing behavior and properties. A significant scientific challenge here is to be able to connect phenomena that occur over several orders of magnitudes of length and time scales (Figure 1 in attachment). To meet such a challenge it is necessary to use a combination of research tools such as experimental measurements of the structure and properties of polymers from molecular to macroscopic scales  coarse-grained-mean-field theory  meso-scale simulations and CFD simulations. This has been a major research theme in my group at the National Chemical Laboratory  Pune. We  in collaboration with the Tata Research Design and Development Centre and the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay  have been gradually building competencies to address a part of this scientific challenge (dotted area in Figure 1 in attachment). In this presentation I will summarize the key historical developments in this area  present contributions from NCL  touch upon some industrially relevant problems to which we are applying our tools and give my perspective on the current state of research.

The production of gas from these naturally occurring gas hydrates is difficult due to complexity of thermodynamics and fluid flow involved in theprocess. This seminar will focus on assessing production of natural gas from methane gas hydrate deposits. An implicit  multiphase  multi-component  thermal  3D simulator is used which can simulate formation and dissociation of hydrates in porous media in both equilibrium and kinetic modes. We have validated the simulator in the DOE code comparison study and with core scale formation and dissociation experiments of methane hydrates. We simulate depressurization and warm water flooding to find the gas production scenarios for confined  unconfined and dipping reservoirs underlain by an aquifer layer. For confined reservoirs production rate increases with increasing injection pressure  but depressurization alone is effective if production well pressure is low. For unconfined reservoirs depressurization is ineffective  thermal stimulation is necessary for gas production. Depressurization alone is effective in dipping unconfined reservoirs  but much slower than warm water injection. As the injection point of the warm water moves down the reservoir  the start of the high gas recovery phase gets delayed  but the time for completion of gas recovery becomes shorter.

Many concentrated paste-like materials are composed of deformable particles randomly packed into a dense suspension.  Examples include dense suspensions of swollen polyelectrolyte microgels  star polymers  and compressed emulsions.  These materials share in common rheological behavior such as wall-slip  shear banding  shear thinning  normal stresses  memory and aging.  Their unique properties make these scientifically interesting and are also important in as rheological modifiers.  Careful experiments identify the influence of chemical nature of the shearing boundary and an elastohydrodynamic lubrication model that captures the corresponding suppression and promotion of slip at the wall will be discussed. Further  a PTV study of flow of pastes near smooth boundaries and the resultant sensitivity of the bulk flow profile to the nature of the shearing surface will also be presented. Other than as rheology modifiers  efficiently engineered combinations of materials can be used to implement process improvements in unlikely areas. For example  water in the form of emulsified droplets in fuel can alleviate issues associated with poor combustion and emissions.  Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO)  one of the less expensive of the refined oil products  is the traditional choice of fuel for Boilers  Thermic Fluid Heaters  Power Generators  etc.  Over the years  refinery process optimization for maximum conversion of crude has resulted in a steady rise in constituent residuals in HFO  only worsened by contamination during fuel distribution process. Quality degradation of HFO ultimately results in incomplete combustion  fouling  particulate emissions  reduced efficiencies  and higher operating and maintenance costs for the ultimate customer of fuel oil.  With intimate understanding of process conditions and of combustion emulsified fuel oil can help solve the problem of poor combustion.  Data from systematic calculations using heat transfer models for combustion of emulsified HFO would be presented along with observations from field installations of emulsification systems in commercial settings. ------------------------ About the Speaker: Jyoti obtained a bachelors degree in Chemical Engineering from Institute of Chemical Technology  Mumbai (2003) followed by masters and doctorate degrees  also in chemical engineering  from the University of Texas at Austin (Dec 2008).

High prices for petroleum  coupled with increased awareness of the environmental impact of the combustion of fossil fuels  are driving a wave of innovation in new energy technologies. Implementation of these replacement technologies requires long  term investment in infrastructure  development of new policies and legislation  and careful analysis of the social and environmental impacts of new technologies. Over the past three decades  Canada has developed the oil sands into a major world petroleum reserve. This presentation will review the technical innovation and policy decisions that enabled investment in the oil sands  and discuss the challenges in managing the social and environmental impacts of a major new industry. This Canadian experience offers important lessons for India as it develops new energy industries based on renewable resources.

These heavy fractions are in a difficult range of molecular size that sits in between common commodity chemicals with simple structure on the one hand  and high polymers with repeating monomer units on the other hand. The association of these components gives rise to complex phase behaviour and physical properties that must be understood in order to develop new process alternatives.

Moreover  recent experimental innovation has led to the synthesis of a diverse range of asymmetric colloidal particles which find many sophisticated applications such as photonic crystals  biological sensors  and optical fibres. While the experimental synthesis of such anisotropic particles can be fairly well‐controlled  we do not yet theoretically understand the behavior of these systems  and hence cannot rationally design materials for specific applications apriori. This talk is motivated towards developing a theoretical understanding of the dynamics and phase behavior of anisotropic colloids. In particular  I will focus on two kinds of anisotropies  (a) Shape‐anisotropic colloidal particles which deviate from the symmetric spherical shape (e.g.  rods)  and (b) chemically anisotropic particles which display heterogeneities on their surface  (e.g.  Janus particles). I will demonstrate the rich variety of thermodynamic and kinetic phase behavior that these anisotropic particles exhibit  such as the formation of attractive and repulsive glasses  gels  crystals  and various self‐assembled structures. The present study contributes towards building a theoretical framework with which to understand these novel systems.

Products in this case are referred to structured materials that assist the process by enhancing their performance. Conventionally  most process-product design problems employ an iterative  trial and error experiment-based procedure. Since experiments are usually expensive and time consuming  the search space for optimal design is limited. Applying computer-aided model-based framework has the potential to save time and expenses  and  widen the search domain for the design alternatives for the process and the products. The key factors for the simultaneous design of the processes and the assisting structured materials are the dependence of the process performance on the properties of the assisting structured material and the dependence of the assisting structured material properties on their microscopic structures. Thus  properties play a central role in the simultaneous process-product design. It is observed that  separating the constitutive equations representing the properties of the assisting structured material from the process model can reduce the computational complexity of the design problem by not having to solve multilevel models (macro-level equations representing the process and micro-level equations representing the structured material) together. This is achieved by employing the reverse algorithm that first defines the design targets in terms of properties of the assisting structured material corresponding to a desired process performance (stage 1)  and then determine structured materials that match the property targets (stage 2). In this way  the process model does not need a property model for the structured material  since the properties are the unknown variables in stage 1. Once the values for the property targets are obtained from the first stage  structured materials corresponding to these properties can be found using property models that relate the properties to the microscopic structure of the structured materials.  The application of molecular modeling in generating property data for the assisting structured materials as a function of the microscopic structure of the structured materials has been investigated and found to add a new dimension to the simultaneous process-product design problem. It has been possible to generate very useful property data through this option. The application for the model-based design framework has been illustrated through case studies involving membrane-based separation processes. In particular  membrane based gas separation have been illustrated in this presentation. The design framework is however general enough to be applicable to other chemical process and product design problems. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- All are cordially invited","webmaster","30 Nov 2011 - 09:15","30 Nov 2011 - 09:20","Seminar/Talk"," Dr. Vipasha Soni   Senior Project Engineer  BASF SE  Germany","Simultaneous model-based design of process and assisting structured materials","Creativity Hall  Room 118  Chemical Eng Department.","1 Dec 2011 - 16:00","1 Dec 2011 - 17:00","185"

Deshpande's Talk","Start: 19 Dec 2011 - 16:00 End: 19 Dec 2011 - 17:00 Abstract: The most general picture of a heterogeneous catalyst is depicted as a  two component system consisting of an active species and a support for the dispersion of the active species. This two  component picture becomes even more important when the active species is a precious metal like platinum. High dispersion of the metal is required and therefore  almost all the heterogeneous catalysts reported in the  literature  and those used industrially  are two component catalysts with metal nanoparticles deposited on a high surface  area support. This forms the category of heterogeneous catalysts what we refer to as metal-on-support  catalysts. We have  however  developed a range of catalysts in which we have successfully incorporated the noble metal  in ionic form in the matrix of the support thereby making a solid solution of the noble metal and the support. We  refer to such systems as metal-in-support catalysts because the metal is actually present in the support rather  than on the support. This structural change brings about vast diﬀerences in the kinetics of the reaction and also  alters the reaction mechanism. We have carried out a thorough structural characterization of the catalysts using  numerous techniques including XRD  XPS  FT- Raman  FT-IR spectroscopy and TEM analysis to prove the substitution of  the metal in the support matrix. The catalysts were tested for a number of gas phase heterogeneous reactions  including syn gas reforming  the water-gas shift reaction  catalytic hydrogen combustion and CO oxidation. This  talk will draw attention of the audience towards the dependence of the reaction kinetics and mechanism on the  identity of the supports for the water-gas shift reaction  thereby rationalizing the idea of metal-in-support  catalysis.

Using a mathematical model that takes into account the transport of  salts through capillary driven films it is shown that an accumulation of solid salt can take place. The extent of  salt accumulation depends on the dimensionless capillary wicking number and the dimensionless pressure  drops. At high wicking numbers and pressure drops supersaturation of brine takes place in the higher  drying rate regions in the porous medium and hence precipitation of the salts leading to higher solid salt  saturation. Results from experiments of flow-through drying in rock cores are compared with model prediction  of salt crystallization and accumulation. In gas wells  with radial flow into the wellbore   supersaturation may result in the near wellbore region leading to a reduction in the near wellbore permeability.

Furthermore  block copolymer lithography has applications in semiconductor design (Tang et al.  2008). This talk will present a field-theoretic model of polymer networks and gels composed of reactive multifunctional monomeric units. Two examples are presented to illustrate the application of self-consistent field theory in determining equilibrium structures arising from reactions among multifunctional monomers. In the first case  network formation and gelation in a confined system of single-component multifunctional monomers is considered. In the second case  microstructures arising from copolymerization reactions in a binary system of multifunctional monomers are investigated. Morphologies arising from copolymerization may range from homogeneous disordered morphologies to ordered microstructures such as lamellae  wherein the distinct constituents assemble into alternating layers. The goal of this work is to enable the rational design of polymer materials with desirable properties  based the a priori prediction of microstructures resulting from selected monomeric constituents.

At these small sizes  while engineers have learned how to define complex devices such as computer chips and microelectromechanical devices  they utilize methods that are inherently two-dimensional (2D). Moreover  it is very challenging to harvest energy to perform mechanized functions  especially off-chip and in a wireless manner  at these small size scales. Self-assembly is a biologically inspired methodology that seeks to construct functional materials and devices using precursors that interact with each other via physical or chemical forces. In this talk  the Speaker will describe static and reconfigurable self-assembly of 3D micro and nanostructures for applications in metamaterials  cell culture  drug delivery  bio-artificial organs and minimally invasive surgery.

While several experiments with well-dispersed nanoparticles have shown modest conductivity enhancements consistent with the Maxwell mean–field theory  more instances of substantially larger enhancements are also reported in recent years. While these observations lend a reasonable confidence to the experimental methods  the variability in the test results also highlights the difficulty of preparation and reproduction of consistent or standardized nanofluid samples. Several new mechanisms have been hypothesized in the recent years to characterize the thermal conduction behavior in nanofluids. In this talk  it is shown that a large set of nanofluid thermal conductivity data is enveloped by the well-known Hashin and Shtrikman (H-S) mean-field bounds for homogeneous systems. The thermal conductivity in nanofluids  therefore  is largely dependent on whether the nanoparticles stay dispersed in the base fluid  form low dimensional  fractal-like configuration  or assume an intermediate configuration. The experimental data  which is strikingly analogous to those in solid composites and liquid mixtures  provide a strong evidence for the classical nature of thermal conduction in nanofluids. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations further demonstrate that H-S limits are universally respected even for sub–nanometer sized clusters.","webmaster","11 Jan 2012 - 09:21","11 Jan 2012 - 09:28","Seminar/Talk","Dr. Jacob Eapen  Assistant Professor  Department of Nuclear Engineering North Carolina State University  USA","Classical Nature of Thermal Conduction in Nanofluids","Room 118 (Creativity Hall  Ground Floor)  Chemical Engineering","12 Jan 2012 - 15:30","12 Jan 2012 - 16:30","185"

Microfluidics offers a promising route to fabricate these systems. In this talk  I will discuss a novel microfluidic technique that we developed based on electrospray in coflow geometries  to generate drops with an average size that can be tuned in an unprecedented range  from well above to well below the smallest geometric feature of the device. The method relies on coupling electric and hydrodynamic forces. Using optical microscopy and high-speed imaging techniques  we demonstrated that the device can be operated in various regimes: dripping  electro-dripping  and an electrically controlled regime. These various regimes allow generation of drops in various sizes compared to the tip diameter. Using the device  we also made fundamental studies on the electric current behavior of electrospray processes and on droplet generation mechanism in microfluidics. Among the prominent applications of emulsions is also their use as templates for synthesis of particles that act as drug delivery vehicles. The graft rejection problem usually encountered in drug delivery applications is typically overcome through cell microencapsulation. Alginate  with its excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability properties  is one of the most commonly used biomaterials in drug delivery and tissue engineering applications. In this talk  I will focus on a robust microfluidic platform we developed for generation of alginate micro particles and the subsequent encapsulation of yeast cells.

Davé's Talk","Start: 27 Jan 2012 - 17:00 End: 27 Jan 2012 - 18:00 Abstract: An overview is presented of the research work on creation of advanced particulate materials through engineering of particles  with applications to pharmaceutical  bio  energetic  and specialty chemical materials. With respect to pharmaceutical applications  the emphasis is on a more effective utilization of the unique properties of nano and sub-micron particles through structuring/engineering of the particulates with an ultimate aim of simplifying the manufacturing processes as well as formulations. In this talk we will also discuss the particle engineering strategy for handling both low and high dosage scenarios for poorly water soluble active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) based formulations. The presented techniques are also naturally suited to those APIs  which are not necessarily poorly water-soluble. In all cases  the emphasis is on scalable methods that are based on sound understanding of materials and processes and help improve the quality of the products while simplifying formulations.             The presentations will also include the topic of improvements and characterization and modeling of flow and other important properties. Particle contact modeling to develop predictive methodologies is reviewed  starting from classical Rumpf single asperity model to some of our advanced models where the influence of material properties  surface area coverage and spatial and size distribution of guest particles is considered. A simplified modeling approach is presented that allows for predicting the bulk performance that requires only small quantities of powders. Finally  2-D phase-maps are developed based on key bulk powder properties to help make manufacturing decisions regarding the formulation strategy for solid pharmaceutical dosages. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- About the Speaker: Dr. Rajesh N.

There are strong interactions between the turbulent fluctuations in the fluid velocity fields  and the velocity fluctuations of the particles. In order to understand the different physical properties such as stresses  heat and mass transfer in turbulent suspensions  it is necessary to have a good understanding of not just the mean flow of the gas and particles  but also of the fluctuations in the two phases. In the seminar the detail of a new modeling approach for turbulent particle laden flows  `fluctuating force' model will be discussed. Such a model has been used to capture the effect of turbulent fluid velocity fluctuations on the particle phase in a turbulent gas-solid suspension in the limit of high Stokes number  which is the ratio of particle relaxation time to the fluid time scale. In the fluctuating force model  forces exerted by the turbulent fluid velocity fluctuations are incorporated in the equation of motion of the particles as anisotropic Gaussian white noise. The noise amplitude is determined from the time correlations of the spatially varying and non-isotropic turbulent fluid velocity fluctuations obtained from Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS). A quantitative comparison of the results obtained from fluctuating force model and DNS for a shear flow (Couette flow  where there is a homogeneous centre region) will be discussed first. Then the applicability of `fluctuating force' model for gravity driven inhomogeneous flow in a vertical channel will be addressed highlighting the concept of `moving Eulerian' reference frame. Comparisons are also made with experimental measurements of the particle velocity distributions using PIV and Particle Tracking Velocimetry using polydisperse particle in the fluctuating force simulations (FFS). Experimental results for both the low and high solid mass loading will be discussed. From the experiments it is observed that there is no significant modification of the fluid phase turbulent intensity at low particle mass loading but at a higher particle mass loading  there is a significant increase in the turbulent velocity fluctuations due to the presence of particles. Therefore it becomes necessary to incorporate the modified fluid turbulence intensity in the fluctuating force modeling to capture the particle statistics.","webmaster","13 Feb 2012 - 11:12","13 Feb 2012 - 11:16","Seminar/Talk","Dr. Partha Sarathi Goswami  CSIR-Centre for Mathematical Modeling and Computer Simulation  Bangalore.","Particle dynamics in a turbulent particle-gas suspension at high Stokes number","Room 118 (Creativity Hall)  Ground Floor  Chemical Engineering Department","16 Feb 2012 - 17:00","16 Feb 2012 - 18:00","185"
145,"3607","Dr. Amit Dutta's Talk","Start: 27 Feb 2012 - 16:00 End: 27 Feb 2012 - 17:00 Abstract: Engineering a surface for desired properties is very important for many industrial and medical applications. The rational design of a surface requires fundamental understanding of the interactions between macromolecules and solid-liquid interfaces. The  mechanical properties of an adsorbed layer are important factors for assessing the behavior of  surfaces. The goals of the research described here are (i) to develop a new method to study protein  cross-liking  (ii) to control the rheological properties of a surface for use as a biosensor.  Increasing the stability of proteins and polypeptides via cross-linking is commonly used to minimize  bio-fouling and to increase the life time of enzymes. Determining the extent of  cross-linking  using say glutaraldehyde  is often accomplished by noting changes in viscosity  that require large amounts of sample at high concentration. Here  we have implemented a highly sensitive quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) technique to address this  limitation. On the other hand  to use a surface for sensor applications  we should be able to control  its physico-chemical properties. We have developed a counter-ion responsive-poly(L-lysin)  (PLL)-based surface  the viscoelastic properties of which can be reversibly controlled. In  principle  this controllable PLL molecule could be used as an ionic gate for drug delivery.          The second part of my presentation will be on development of a  surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based method to analyze glycosylation of monoclonal  antibody. Current analytical methods for characterizing glycosylation such as high  performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry are capable of rigorously  determining composition  sequence  linkage  and stereoisomerism of glycans. Although powerful  techniques  they are time consuming and require considerable expertise. In this work  lectins were  immobilized on a self assembled monolayer (SAM) of HS-(CH2)_11-(OCH2CH2)_6-OCH_2-COOH and the  interactions between lectins  concanavalin A (ConA)  wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)   peanut agglutinin (PNA)  and rituximab were analyzed using SPR. We found that covalent  attachment of ConA to the SAM first followed by adsorption of rituximab results in reversible  binding. In contrast  covalent attachment of rituximab first  followed by adsorption of ConA  resulted in irreversible adsorption of ConA. In summary  we have focused our attention on macromolecules at  solid-liquid interfaces and measured the protein/polypeptide-surface interactions in order to  engineer surfaces with particular properties for specific applications. ------------------------------------------------------","webmaster","22 Feb 2012 - 09:41","22 Feb 2012 - 09:48","Seminar/Talk","Dr. Amit Dutta  NRC Postdoctoral Research Associate  National Institute of Standards and Technology  100 Bureau Drive  Gaithersburg  MD 20899  USA.","Macromolecules at Solid-Liquid Interfaces","Room 118 (Creativity Hall)  Ground Floor  Chemical Engineering Department","27 Feb 2012 - 16:00","27 Feb 2012 - 17:00","185"

Network polymers formed by catalytic polymerization of di-cyclo-penta-diene (DCPD) is engaged as a model system due to its application in self healing materials. MD simulations are used to describe the evolution of the mechanical properties. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were deployed in order to predict differences in properties of network polymers as those formed by catalytic ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of DCPD. Networks formed by ROMP mechanisms were compared with those of random (RAND) cross linked polymers such as epoxies using a coarse grained (CG) approach. The CG model used Lennard Jones (LJ) particles and Hookean bond and angle constraints. Insights from these CG simulations were used to design fully atomistic simulations for ROMP of DCPD. Mechanical properties such as Young’s Modulus and Poisson’s ratio were predicted at various degrees of reaction. These simulations predict two distinct transitions in mechanical response as reaction proceeds viz. liquid to rubber and then on to glassy structures. Comparisons with experiments will be presented.

Metabolic engineering deals with performing genetic alterations to a wild type strain i.e. a strain as it exists in nature such that the mutant can overproduce some metabolite of commercial interest. Synthetic biology deals with the construction of artificial biological systems for the purpose of studying important biological processes or for the purpose of strain improvement. A common aim in both the disciplines is strain improvement which is the focus of this work. Strain improvement refers to the process of making alterations to a wild type strain such that the engineered strain has superior properties in comparison to the original strain in the context of some objective such as the production of a metabolite. Towards this end  the work has three contributions. The first contribution is towards proposing an algorithm for identifying housekeeping genes i.e. genes performing important cellular functions from microarray gene expression data. We analyze the functions of a few genes obtained by applying the proposed algorithm to gene expression data of human lymphoblastoid cells and liver tissue and in each case we show that the genes indeed perform vital functions. The second contribution of this work is towards gaining insights into optimal ethanol production by the unicellular photosynthetic cyanobacterium Synechocystis species strain PCC 6803. Analysis suggests that combined gene deletions in ethanol and purine metabolism pathways result in optimal ethanol production along with the mutant producing the specified amount of biomass. The third contribution of the work provides an efficient alternate formulation for the Regulatory on off minimization (ROOM) algorithm. The ROOM algorithm is a popular metabolic modeling strategy for mutants and involves solving an integer programming problem. In the current work  motivated by the emerging area of compressed sensing  we propose a reformulation  known as basis-pursuit  of the original ROOM algorithm. Applying the original ROOM algorithm and the reformulation to various mutants of Synechocystis species strain PCC 6803  it is observed that the proposed algorithm performs better in most cases.

High equipment density coupled with storage under pressure and many potential leakage and ignition sources contribute to a high explosion risk. Serious accidents that have occurred both offshore and onshore in the past demonstrate the necessity of this strong emphasis on safety. The seminar starts by briefly discussing the combustion mechanisms important during explosions and the factors affecting these mechanisms. The necessity of using CFD for prediction of the consequences of explosions occurring in a process facility is then established. The models included in CFD tool FLACS that has been specifically developed for this purpose are described. Extensive modelling and validation work has recently been carried out to make FLACS a more reliable tool for hydrogen safety applications. This is driven by the expectation that hydrogen can become an important energy carrier in the future. In general  hydrogen is much more explosive than e.g. gasoline. But hydrogen also has some positive qualities such as very large buoyancy that can minimize the risk of a spill. It is therefore important to develop good tools for calculating the consequences of possible accidents. The study treats release  dispersion  combustion and explosion of hydrogen and development of risk analysis methods. Some examples and approaches of how this tool is applied for performing explosion safety assessments for process facilities are also presented.

The recent development in nanoscience  surface chemistry and environmental engineering has a substantial influence in the paving the way for development of nanoscale materials   adsorbents  porous materials  nano-catalyst   photocatalytic materials  coagulant formulations  etc. There is always a scope for development of new materials through modifications and understanding of the  surface phenomenon. The goal is to evolve materials that have specific application with maximum sustainability and techno-economical ease for removal  of  contaminant species.  These materials may also be specifically developed/functionalized for wide spectrum of environmental applications like Desulfurization of transportation fuels  i.e. the removal or reduction of sulfur content from gasoline and diesel; removal of dyes  acids  phenolic compounds etc from industrial wastewaters. In  the  development of any industrial wastewater treatment methodology   and also for dye wastewater  a wise combination of various techniques  generally physico-chemical  techniques in a sequential manner  offers a  nearly  complete solution.  In this regard  the application of formulated coagulants as a pretreatment in decolorization of dye wastewater and maximum removal of wastewater parameters like COD  BOD and TOC  requires understanding of the mechanism behind the colloidal dispersion  charge phenomenon  composition of coagulant species  size of the cation in case of metal ions etc requires detailed investigation. In case of photocatalytic materials for dye degradation  the supporting media for porous materials may vary from  modified forms of various activated carbons to nanocomposites to fibres to mesoporous silica.  The strategy of combining different technologies for treatment of refractory pollutants is a potential advantage of new material development like in the case adsorption coupled photo catalytic dye degradation. In short for selective and efficient removal of pollutants from  aqueous or  non-aqueous phase  a deep understanding of material properties/screening of materials   along with comprehensive investigation for standardization of process removal is necessitated.

They may be either emitted into the atmosphere or formed within the atmosphere itself. Atmospheric pollution studies in urban industrialized areas are of increasing interest as it has been well established that  in addition to their significant effect on Earth’s climate the fine aerosol particles originated from urban industrialized regions are directly related to adverse human health impact. A dedicated operational monitoring is thus required for the assessment of the atmospheric concentration of particulate matter at various time and space scales. LIDAR based technology is proved to be a powerful tool because of a large range of investigation and a high observation repetition rate. Together with satellite remote sensing  it can provide a detailed overview of aerosol spatial variability at a fine scale  adequate for health impact assessment. We will present here different aspects of our recent researches on aerosol remote sensing and health impact assessment.","webmaster","17 Jul 2012 - 08:24","17 Jul 2012 - 08:48","Seminar/Talk","Dr. Jean-Francois Leon Laboratoire d'Aérologie & Observatoire Midi-Pyrénées  FRANCE","Monitoring of particulate air pollution for health impact assessment: active and passive remote sensing","Room 118 (Creativity Hall)  Ground Floor  Chemical Engineering Department","18 Jul 2012 - 16:00","18 Jul 2012 - 17:00","185"

Industrial societies are increasingly recognizing the need for shifting to more environmentally conscious activities. Consequently  there is a need for modifying existing processes and developing new technologies that minimize environmental impact while providing stimulating economic value to businesses. Over the last few decades  issues such as fossil fuel depletion and global warming have strongly motivated research on renewable energy technologies.  Among the alternatives being developed  biofuels have gained an increased interest worldwide due to abundant availability of biomass in many countries.  In addition to technological advances  development of appropriate biofuel policy and corporate decisions about adopting or manufacturing these products require insight into the life cycle environmental implications of alternate technologies.  Such life cycle or footprint information for biofuels has not been available for India  and such studies for other countries are of limited use. In this presentation  we will describe our effort for developing a life cycle inventory for producing ethanol from various lignocellulosic feedstocks available in India.  The biggest challenge in such work is collection of relevant data. In this work  data is compiled from different sources such as journal articles  the ministries of statistics and agriculture  the Indiastat database  and communication with individual experts. Variation in the inventory is addressed by collecting data from multiple sources  when available  and doing the calculations with mean  median  high and low values. This work considers the life cycles of ethanol production from feedstocks such as sugarcane  cotton stalk  rice husk  wheat stalk  sorghum stalk  and sugarcane bagasse.  These are compared based on metrics such as energy return on investment  life cycle greenhouse gas emissions or carbon footprint  land use  and water use per litre of ethanol produced.  Advanced thermodynamic methods such as exergy and emergy analysis are used to provide deeper insight about the life cycle  such as the contribution of ecosystem services  and opportunities for improving the life cycle impact.  These methods also provide aggregate sustainability metrics. The present work contributes to this effort by exploring the application of life cycle assessment  first law energy analysis  and exergy analysis  emergy analysis to emerging technologies. It also provides useful insight for policy decision making for biofuel sector. Acrolein production case study provides the application of the systems approaches for selection of the alternative from bio and fossil resources. Challenges in extending this work to a complete life cycle impact assessment  and to consider a broader analysis boundary will also be discussed.

These studies show that a larger fraction of the total  resource used in the society gets wasted.  The aim of this work is to  gain insight into the metabolism of India over the last four decades as  it evolved from a controlled to a more open free market economy  and its  implication for sustainable development. Trends of emissions  resource  consumption  and its conversion into useful work in various sector  (Utility  Industry  Transport  Residential-commercial and Agriculture)   are analyzed using exergy analysis and the results are compared with  those of other developing and developed economies. This work also  focuses on the conversion of resources to useful work with change in  technology  industrialization and economic liberalization.

The dynamics of polymer having diﬀerent lengths  crossing over a free energy barrier which is relevant to many biological processes like  DNA translo- cation through membrane will be discussed. The ﬁrst part of the talk  deals with short chain crossing over a barrier to show the dependence of activation  energy and the rate of the process on the chain length. For the case of a star  polymer crossing over a barrier  it crosses the barrier as a globule when it is short and  as stretched state when it is long. Activation energy and the rate have an  interesting dependence on the arm length of the star. Previous work on the barrier crossing of  a long chain polymer shows that analytical kink solution exists in one dimension. The  numerical evidence of the kink solution in one and three dimensions will be shown.  The next part of the talk describes using path integral variational approach the calculation of survival probability for rate processes with dynamical disorder that  is relevant to the loop closing problem of DNA replication. Both upper and lower bounds to the survival probability and a lower bound to the rate are derived. In the  last part of the talk our recent progress at developing simulation methodologies for  biosystems will be discussed. The functionalities of biomolecular assemblies such  as membranes  proteins occur on a wide variety of time and length scales. In order to  comprehend the physical and chemical phenomena  multiscale modeling has emerged as  a highly promising simulation approach in recent years. Integrating the  information from the experiments  multiscale simulations and the theory can give insights  into the involved physical principles related to phenomena in soft condensed  matter in future.","webmaster","8 Oct 2012 - 10:02","8 Oct 2012 - 10:12","Seminar/Talk","Dr. Ananya Debnath Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research  Ackermannweg 10  55128 Mainz  Germany.","Modelling of processes involving biological chain and macro molecules","Room 118 (Creativity Hall)  Ground Floor  Chemical Engineering Department","11 Oct 2012 - 17:00","11 Oct 2012 - 18:00","185"
162,"4101","Dr.Bhaswar Ghosh's Talk","Start: 11 Oct 2012 - 12:00 End: 11 Oct 2012 - 13:00 Abstract: The 137 genes encoding 78 different ribosomal proteins (RPs)  in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are tightly co-regulated at the transcriptional level  yet their promoters display relatively  little sequence conservation. Here we describe how the transcriptional  output and regulation of this suite of genes is encoded in their  promoter DNA.  By analyzing ChIP-seq data for four different factors  (RAP1  FHL1  IFH1 and HMO1)  we identify two general promoter classes   characterized by the presence or absence of the HMG-box protein HMO1.  The first class contains HMO1-bound promoters  where we observe the  absence of FHL1 DNA-binding sites which may imply that in these cases  the HMO1 proteintethersFHL1 to the promoters. However  at promoters not  occupied by HMO1  we found the presence of FHL1 DNA-binding sites  suggesting direct binding to DNA. To examine the effect of the different  classes of promoter architectures on the transcriptional activities  we  further measured the promoter activities of 119 RP promoters. We first  observed that the HMO1-boundpromoters are more tightly transcribed  compared to other categories. In addition  a linear model relating  expression to promoter features  such as binding strength of the  regulators and nucleosome occupancy  was able to capture a significant  portion of the variance in promoter activities of HMO1-independent RP  genes  which was not the case forHMO1-associated promoters.  This  suggests that the HMO1-associated promoters are more robust to  variability in the binding of different transcription factors compared  to HMO1-independent cases. We further found that this robustness relates  to higher sensitivities of HMO1-associated RP genes to some  environmental perturbations compared to HMO1-independent classes.

The successful implementation of such reactors requires the integration of competencies from material science  catalysis  chemical engineering and mechanical engineering. In this talk  the design  fabrication and applications of two types of microstructured reactors ( viz. monoliths and microchannel reactors) will be presented. For the last 3 decades  monolith catalysts have been used for treatment of automobile exhaust  and for selective reduction of NOx in flue gases. However  their use in other gas-solid and multiphase catalytic  reactions has not been fully exploited. The characteristics and preparation of monolith reactors will be briefly presented and their performance in some specific gas- solid reactions  and multiphase reactions discussed. It will be shown that  depending on the relative rates of mass transfer and reaction  it is possible to achieve higher selectivities and/or higher productivities  in monolith reactors than in conventional reactors.

The next generation droplet based lab-on-chip devices can possibly revolutionize combinatorial drug screening and high throughput analysis of chemicals and cells.  Ladder network is an example of a microfluidic device that is designed to achieve synchronization of pairs of drops. Ladder networks have two parallel channels that are interconnected by bypass channels. The droplets travel in the main channels and the bypass channels are inaccessible to droplets. To optimally design ladder networks there is a need to develop appropriate modeling and design algorithms. Using the concepts of a network model  a generic simulation approach for the ladder networks is developed. Using this simulation model we predict that the ladder networks with fore-aft structural symmetry are limited to reducing droplet spacing. Additionally  we show that asymmetry in ladder networks provide additional functionalities such as expansion  contraction  flipping and synchronization of drops. Typical objective functions for optimizing ladder network designs are binary and discontinuous. Therefore  conventional gradient based approaches for design are difficult to implement. In this talk  we propose a genetic algorithm based approach to design these networks. A novel encoding scheme is proposed to handle experimental constraints. In this work  we discuss the design of ladder networks for two different objectives using genetic algorithms: (i) Ladder networks that encode and decode droplets as they travel through the device  (ii) Ladder networks that synchronize drops that enter with a mean and a variance in delay.  In the first case  the design generated by the genetic algorithm transforms the exit spacing of the drops to a sigmoid function. In the second case  the ladder networks act at as a filter  where the inlet spacing of droplets is amplified by the first few bypasses and reduced by the other bypasses.

Here  I will discuss our efforts to tune interfacial properties by modulating wetting or hydrodynamic interactions. The interactions dominant within a few nanometers of a fluid−surface interface dictate properties such as adhesion  friction  and spreading. Modulating such interactions  therefore  can lead to dramatic changes in response of the fluid−surface interface. For example  spreading of a liquid drop on a surface in response to charging of the underlying dielectric (referred to as electrowetting on dielectric) can lead to drop motion and is employed for digital microfluidics  electronic displays  and variable-focus lenses. We studied electrowetting at length scales ranging from nanoscopic to macroscopic  and our results unequivocally establish the underlying mechanism and nanoscale limits of this approach. Furthermore  we designed an approach where molecular reorientation at the fluid−surface interface is used to control macroscopic shape and motion of drops that are subjected to a constant driving force on a chemically homogeneous surface. I will also discuss our current work on understanding the effect of surface chemistry and topography on the wetting of cryogenic fluids. Systems operating in fluid environments such as robots traversing flooded surfaces necessitate modulation of dynamic interactions  i.e.  drag or friction. I will discuss how surface structures that form draining channels such as those inspired by tree frog toe pads can be designed to modulate hydrodynamic interactions. Using direct force measurements  we extracted scaling arguments that can be employed for the optimised design of reversible biomimetic adhesives for flooded surfaces.

This “meso-superstructured solar cell” exhibits exceptionally few fundamental energy losses; it can generate open-circuit photovoltages of more than 1.1 volts  despite the relatively narrow absorber band gap of 1.55 electron volts.

Kadu's Talk","Start: 18 Apr 2013 - 17:00 End: 18 Apr 2013 - 18:00 Abstract:   Various deterministic sampling-based constrained state estimation techniques for non-linear dynamical systems have been proposed in the literature. These algorithms mainly focus on correcting the estimated (or filtered) states such that they satisfy all of the given constraints. However  the aspect of correcting predicted states (after model propagation) such that they satisfy all of the constraints has not been given much attention in the literature. These states are obtained by propagating deterministically chosen points (called sigma points) through the process model. Most approaches either do not incorporate constraints during the generation of these sigma points or use arbitrary strategies for constraint incorporation. Further  the weights associated with these points are not systematically updated after incorporation of any state constraint. In this article  we propose an optimization-based sigma points selection approach that overcomes these limitations. Additionally  we incorporate the effect of constraints by directly working with truncated probability density functions. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated by comparing its performance against those of various strategies available in the literature on several simulation.","webmaster","17 Apr 2013 - 09:54","17 Apr 2013 - 10:07","Seminar/Talk","Sachin C.

However  in our daily life  we perceive adhesion as the energy or force required to separate two adhering objects. This energy of de-bonding is a strong function of the  bulk mechanical properties of the separating objects. For example  rheological properties play a very crucial role in determining the  adhesion strength of pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs) used in scotch tape. Other than material properties  micro-patterns at the surface  heavily influences adhesion by frustrating stress concentration and arresting a propagating crack. Other than surface structures   sub-surface structures can also significantly influence adhesion  as we  demonstrated in my doctoral work. In the first part of my talk  I'll  elaborate how adhesion can be controlled by altering the mechanics using  embedded structures. By intelligent manipulation with channel geometry  and arrangement  adhesion can be improved by 70 times compared to an unstructured smooth adhesive. The adhesive is reusable  effective under  water and  shows directional adhesion depending on the arrangement of the sub-surface structures.     In the second part of my talk  I'll discuss how mechanics control  cell behavior and fate. In cell biology  form and function are  inseparable and interdependent. In addition to bio-chemical signals   cell behavior is strongly influenced by physical cues such as substrate  topology  stiffness  fluid shear  mechanical strain and ligand  distribution which define the tissue-specific micro-environment or  niche. Cells respond to these physico-chemical cues by modifying their  focal adhesion and cytoskeletal/nuclear stiffness which in turn  influence cell migration  aggregation  morphogenesis and gene  expression. Therefore  understanding cell mechanics is crucial to  control and optimize any tissue-specific cell behavior. In addition to  giving a general overview  I'll specifically talk about our work aiming  to understand the role of diverse mechano-signals in the context of the choice between quiescence and proliferation in mesenchymal stem cells. *Biography*     Abhijit did his under-graduation in Chemical Engineering from REC Durgapur and his M.Tech in Cryogenic engineering from IIT Kharagpur.

In this talk  I will describe a cross-disciplinary approach at the intersection of nanotechnology  polymer chemistry  and immunology for the molecular design of a safe  needle-free  and efficacious nanoparticle-based platform that can address these challenges and can provide a robust technology to address both pre- and post-exposure to respiratory pathogens. These biodegradable nanoparticles are based on amphiphilic polyanhydrides  which degrade by hydrolytic cleavage of the anhydride bond. We have shown using a bottom-up approach that vaccine adjuvants based on amphiphilic polyanhydride nanoparticles are capable of mimicking a natural infection and inducing a robust immune response with long-lived protection against a subsequent challenge. The nanoparticles possess the unique ability to mimic pathogens with respect to persisting within and activating immune cells as well as rapidly distributing to tissue sites distal to the site of administration. Furthermore  these particles can be targeted for uptake by immune cells by functionalizing their surface with carbohydrates  enabling more efficient delivery of antigen to dendritic cells and macrophages. Our studies have shown that the nanoparticles are safe when administered via multiple routes – intranasal  subcutaneous  and intramuscular. These particles are stable at high temperature for extended periods of time obviating the “cold chain”  which is a major hurdle in the deployment of vaccines to remote regions of the globe. The nanoparticles can be designed to encapsulate fragile protein antigens and deliver them in a sustained manner to immune cells  facilitating the maintenance of antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. We have demonstrated that these nanovaccines confer full protection in a single intranasal dose ten months prior to lethal challenge by several respiratory pathogens. Additionally  these particles can be used for effective intracellular delivery of antibiotics in a single administration  which results in lower toxicity  enhanced patient compliance  dose sparing  and cost savings. This rational approach for designing novel amphiphilic materials as nanoscale adjuvants and therapeutics has the tantalising potential to catalyze the development of next generation technologies against emerging and re-emerging diseases.

The dependence of the zero shear rate viscosity on concentration is observed to display universal behaviour  that can be understood within the framework of the blob theory for semidilute polymer soludons. Further  the shear rate dependence of viscosity  at various temperatures and concentrations  can be collapsed  onto master curves when understood in terms of a relaxation time that depends on concentration. Computational prediction of the static and dynamic properties of semldllute polymer solutions requires the  simulation of a large system of polymer chains interacting with each other through excluded volume and hydrodynamic Interactions. We describe the development of a Brownian dynamics simulation algorithm that uses a  fast implementation of the Ewald summation method to obtain predictions of the concentration dependence of static propertIes such as the radius of gyration and of dynamic properties such as the long-time diffusivity  and the viscosity. Predictions are compared with experimental observatlons on DNA solutions.","webmaster","4 Dec 2012 - 16:23","4 Dec 2012 - 16:31","Seminar/Talk","Prof. Ravi Prakash Jagadeeshan  Department of Chemical Engineering Monash University","Concentration Dependent Dynamics Of Semi-Dilute DNA Solutions","Room 118 (Creativity Hall)  Ground Floor  Chemical Engineering Department","6 Dec 2012 - 17:00","6 Dec 2012 - 18:00","185"

Venue:  Room 240  Department of Chemical Engineering. Date: Monday 21st December 4-5 PM. Abstract: A modern food system needs to be an intelligence-empowered system that includes capability for information collection/processing and decision making  mechatronics devices for sensing  controls and actions  and synergistic integration of components into functional systems. FEWS activities incorporate actions taken by many players in physical spaces. Ideally  these actions should be supported and guided by the intelligence obtained from analyses of information in cyber spaces. A cyber system consisting of effective content and efficient delivery methods will be very valuable in empowering farmers  manufacturers  consumers  and policy makers in their decision making. Intelligence-enabling information technologies that can potentially empower FEWS analysis  planning  design  management  and operation include: (1) Perception; (2) Reasoning and Learning; (3) Communication; (4) Task Planning and Execution; and (5) Systems Integration. Currently  systems integration is arguably the weakest aspect when addressing the food system. A Concurrent Science  Engineering and Technology (ConSEnT) cyber platform may be created based on the above-stated concept and framework using current and emerging informatics  analytics  and computational technologies. This cyber platform will facilitate the necessary systems integration tasks for sharing information among interested participants  conducting efficient analyses of local and global level issues  and creating value-added information to support decisions and actions. Human users are the center of this networking platform. As alluded to in the above  there are three key dimensions in the platform that are coupled to provide the users desirable utilities: Systems informatics  Information analysis methods and tools  and Systems analytics and decision support. It is obvious that ConSEnT will require many participants from a wide range of disciplines to make it function to its fullest extent. However  it is possible to start showing its usefulness when a critical amount of information  analytical tools  and actionable information become available and continue to evolve. The key is to systematically take necessary steps to involve key participants and configure a concurrent analysis platform structure that has the potential to be scaled-up and scaled-out.

Abstract: Protection of climate and anticipative shift from fossil based to renewable feedstock are driving bioeconomy in the US and around the world. The consumer appeal for green products is creating demand for biobased chemicals and polymers.  It is estimated that 20% of today’s petrochemical production will be replaced with biobased chemicals in the next decade.  Large amounts of renewable carbon in form of fermentable sugars are needed to enable production of next generation biochemicals and biofuels.  Although cellulosic feedstocks are on the horizon  starch and sugars from corn and sugarcane will continue to play an important role in shaping biobased economy around the world. New partnerships are forming between major starch/sugar processing  biotech  chemical and petrochemical companies to build biorefineries for production of biobased building blocks and/or polymers. Opportunities  catalyzed by innovation from public-private partnerships exist for capital investment  construction of new biorefineries  jobs creation and new markets for biobased products. Research and development  derisking and commercialization of bioprocessing technologies are critical to realize widespread benefits of this new economic activity.  Role of the Integrated Bioprocess Research Laboratory (IBRL) at the University of the Illinois in shaping this economic activity in the State of Illinois  US and around the world will be presented.

The need for new antibiotics is emerging as a result of continuous evolution of disease causing bacteria into drug resistant strains due to their extra ordinary ability to adapt to changes in their environment. The ultimate aim of this work was to design a cell factory that can be used as a plug and play superhost for enhanced production of new polyketide pharmaceuticals. To approach this goal we used the actinomycete /Streptomyces coelicolor/A3(2) and the blue colored polyketide antibiotic actinorhodin produced by it as a model system. We explored two strategies to improve actinorhodin production. One of the strategies involved studying the effect of energy perturbation on actinorhodin production in /S. coelicolor/. This was achieved by over-expressing NADH kinase and NADH oxidase that led to changes in the NADH/NAD^+ ratio in the cell. Overexpression of NADH oxidase resulted in decreased yield of biomass on glucose and increased yield of actinorhodin  while overexpression of NADH kinase led to increased yield of biomass on glucose and decreased yield of actinorhodin. The other strategy focused on the principle of “promoter engineering” by constructing a synthetic promoter library to obtain promoters with a range of expression levels. The promoter of /actII orf4/ – the positive activator of the actinorhodin gene cluster  was randomized in this study and a library of different promoter strengths was constructed and characterized. One of the strains ScoSPL20 in the library demonstrated 2.8 times higher yields of actinorhodin than compared to wild type strain. We report the successful application of promoter engineering in improving actinorhodin production.","webmaster","10 Dec 2012 - 12:19","10 Dec 2012 - 12:24","Seminar/Talk","Dr. Sujata Sohoni Research Scientist at Novozymes","Promoter engineering and energy perturbation to improve  antibiotic production in /Streptomyces coelicolor","Room 118 (Creativity Hall)  Ground Floor  Chemical Engineering Department","12 Dec 2012 - 12:00","12 Dec 2012 - 13:00","185"

Chain conformation of Side-Group Liquid Crystalline Polymers (SGLCPs)  block copolymers in which the order of the LC mesogen couples with the flexible backbone  has been investigated. Distinct chemistries and coupling are examined that induce the formation of unusually large morphologies displaying spontaneous anisotropy and restructuring across a narrow temperature window. Conformational comprehension of these diblocks opens opportunities in responsive LC interfaces with in-built functionality. Significance of self-assembly environment has been demonstrated using β-hairpin peptides  capable of self-assembly and hydrogel formation. The stimuli-responsive self-assembly occurs via a strand interdigitation mechanism  resulting in semi-flexible fibrillar networks. Change in the chemistry leads to fibrils with distinct morphologies that affect the bulk rheological behavior of the gels.

This talk will be an attempt to integrate the fundamentals of mechanical  chemical and bio-engineering to understand bio-nanoparticle behavior in liquid and aerosol phases. The first part of this talk will focus on research efforts undertaken at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)  Gaithersburg  using a state-of-the-art gas-phase ion mobility technique known as Electrospray-Differential Mobility Analysis (ES-DMA). An ES-DMA first aerosolizes nanoparticles (typically in the size range of 2.7 nm to 400 nm) from liquid phase and then characterizes them based on the balance of drag and electrical forces. Results from ES-DMA will be demonstrated to explain the complex phenomenon of protein adsorption and desorption from surfaces. ES-DMA is further utilized to characterize protein aggregates. Some examples will be presented to demonstrate that ES-DMA can complement or at times outperform other industrial gold-standard liquid-phase techniques (e.g. size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation). This talk will also demonstrate ES-DMA’s capabilities upon integration with aerosol particle mass analyzers (which classifies particles based on the balance of electrical and centrifugal forces) to quantify ligand adsorption to nanoparticles. The second part of the talk will focus on Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) efforts to understand the harmful effects of bionanoparticles in aerosolized form to human beings and how protective devices such as respirators or masks can reduce such exposure. We are currently developing computational models validated by experimental results for understanding aerosol transport through protective devices such as masks/respirators which concomitantly would aid in our understanding of risks posed by exposure to bionanoparticles.

Krishnakumar's Talk","Start: 12 Aug 2013 - 00:41 Abstract: Cyanobacteria are a group of photosynthetic prokaryotes that inhabit in diverse ecosystems with simple oxygen (O2) evolving mechanism similar to that in higher plants. They are believed to be responsible for the creation of oxygenic atmosphere on earth and are credited with 20-30% of the global photosynthesis currently. Cyanobacteria use light energy from the sunlight to fix atmospheric CO2 and convert it into energy rich sugar molecules for their growth  development and metabolic process. Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142  a non-heterocystous diazotrophic unicellular organism is one amongst the photosynthetic cyanobacterial community known well to perform both oxygenic photosynthesis and oxygen-sensitive nitrogenfixation temporally. This organism has extraordinary metabolic capabilities and is reported to produce higher amount of hydrogen (H2) under nitrogen fixing conditions. However  commercial considerations in growing this type cultures typically demand high cell density cultivations  which usually result in photo-limitation or photo-inhibition due to self-shading and uneven light distribution at high cell growth. A potential remedy would be culturing these cells under turbulent condition  which could alleviate such problems as a result of flashing light effect and cyclic movement of cells between light and dark zones. However  introducing turbulence along with aeration in reactor vessel can increase the oxygen tension in the media  which may affect nitrogen fixation and growth under nitrogen fixing conditions. We demonstrate the robustness and metabolic potential of Cyanothece 51142 at nitrogen fixing conditions through analyzing the online exhaust gas CO2 and O2 profiles under the influence of varying the agitation rates. From this study  we ascertain that the agitation speed at 600 rpm in stirred vessel provide optimal growth for this organism than the conventional shake flask and flat panel bioreactor studies. Further  Cyanothece 51142 tend to oscillate between day and night time metabolisms in response to light/dark (LD) or continuous light (LL) cycles  we therefore investigate the periodicity  behavioral pattern and robustness of free-run metabolic oscillations in tandem with gene expression studies under prolonged LL condition. We show that Cyanothece 51142 exhibit ~11h period sustained oscillations under extended LL condition  with fair synchronization between the online exhaust gas profiles and the results of biochemical and gene expression analysis. We also develop and demonstrate a novel functional re-annotation tool called “SHARP” (Systematic  Homology-based Automated Re-annotation for Prokaryotes) to predict the Gene-Protein-Reaction (GPR) associations based on distant context-specific sequence similarities and probabilistic optimization approach  predominantly from cyanobacterial species. The predicted GPR associations using SHARP led to the identification of several important pathways which can provide new directions in performing metabolic engineering studies to produce useful products.

These sources are generally characterized by mass emission factors. However  both from optical and health effect point of view  it is important to assess the number loading factors in the far field domains. The process of coagulation of the nanoparticles formed near the sources coupled with inevitable atmospheric dispersion are the fundamental mechanisms of transformation of aerosols as they spread over far field regions. Since the coagulation effects dominate essentially near the source  it is useful to develop analytical correlations for the number survival fractions which may be incorporated as source modifier terms in large scale aerosol transport models. Towards this end we explore analytical approximations to predict practically relevant persisting aerosol metrics for the cases of both localized and spatially homogeneous releases.

There are two main reasons for using this technique. Firstly  the selective solvating power of supercritical fluids makes it possible to separate a particular component from a multi-component mixture. Secondly  the favourable mass transfer properties and high solubility of solvent in supercritical fluid make the formation of the microparticles rapid and efficient. Supercritical fluids also offer various other advantages such as use of organic solvents  high temperatures  high sheer stresses can be avoided which can therefore aid in the effective  safe and green processing of APIs and pharmaceutical excipients. Solubility behaviour of supercritical fluid can be altered or tuned by the fine adjustment of pressure and temperature. Supercritical fluids can also be utilised as a solute and can help in the depression of melting point or glass transition temperature of an excipient  allowing microparticle production at far lower temperatures. The processing of excipients and APIs with supercritical CO2 and utilisation of this approach in the development of novel drug delivery systems (NDDS) is an attractive proposition because of above mentioned advantages. Our group is particularly interested in the ""safe"" formulation of NDDS for biologics for oral delivery which also entails incorporation of bio- molecules and proteins into inorganic host materials. Immobilisation of biologics on a solid surface improves their thermal and chemical stability. These biologics on an inorganic host can then be safely coated with lipids and/or other suitable excipient using supercritical fluid processing. This approach can provide sustained  targeted and safe passage to a drug to the lower intestine where it can be released and absorbed.

These range from personal care products like shampoos  tooth paste  etc.; health care products like ointments syrups  etc.; Food products like milk  chocolates ice-creams  mayonnaise etc.; and also paints.  Most of these materials are viscoelastic and are known as soft solids/soft matter. These materials are sheared during various processing applications where they are required to flow or change from being predominantly elastic to predominantly plastic (liquid like). This solid to liquid transition is called as yielding. Yielding in these non-Newtonian fluids is a complex phenomenon and it pertains to their complex microstructure  various physical/chemical interactions between their components and the multiconstituent nature of these systems. The flow induces changes in the microstructure which in turn affects the mechanical properties of the final product. It is important to investigate the structure of soft matter over a hierarchy of length and time scales  and to see how the structure leads to properties of the material .To understand the microstructure and flow behavior of these complex materials  usually simple colloidal suspensions are studied as model systems.   We investigate dense suspensions of deformable PolyN-isopropylacrylamide (PNIPAM) microgels as model system to study soft pasty materials. PNIPAM is a thermoresponsive polymer and undergoes a large volume phase transition (VPTT) at ~320C. Thus the volume fraction in this system can be tuned by merely changing the temperature without changing the number density. The sensitivity to change size on changing temperature allows the microgels to be packed in volume fractions greater than 1 and thus serves as a good model for soft colloidal glasses.We use Diffusive Wave Spectroscopy (DWS)  a state of the art technique in light scattering to investigate the micro-structure and dynamics in this system under quiescent conditions. The yielding studies involve use of mechanical rheology specifically under large amplitude oscillatory shear where we study the non-linear response of these materials. From our results we show that highly concentrated suspensions of deform-able materials show complex dynamics under quiescent as well as under nonlinear deformations. We also ascertain universal attributes of yielding in a variety of soft materials when sheared under large amplitude oscillatory shear.

Very recent experiments report that when $0.1$ M solutions of $CdCl_2$ and $Na_2 S$ were allowed to mix through some anodised alumunium oxide (AAO) nanochannels  one observes the growth of an array of $CdS$ nano-cylinders on only one end of the AAO template [A. Varghese and S. Datta  Phys. Rev. E . {\bf 85}  056104 (2012)]. These cylinders have a pore along the center of the cylinder but closed at one end. The reaction happens only in the $Na_2S$ chamber  and growth of cylinders of uniform size and shape continues as long as the supply of the reactant molecules ($CdCl_2$ and $Na_2S$ ) is maintained. To try to understand the physics of the observed phenomenon  we propose a model mechanism where the $Cd^{+2}$ ions exit the AAO-nanochannel to enter $Na_2 S$ chamber with a finite velocity  these ions then react with the diffusing $S^{-2}$ ions to form $CdS$ which then self assemble to form cylinders of uniform width and cross-section. The flow of $Cd^{+2}$ out of the AAO nano-channel is the key symmetry breaking feature which fecilitates formation of uniform cylindrical structures of $CdS$ instead of a $CdS$ precipitate. Since our model does not crucially depend on the chemical details of the reaction  this mechanism can be extended to self-assemble other structures of relevance.","webmaster","26 Mar 2013 - 09:10","26 Mar 2013 - 09:13","Seminar/Talk","Apratim Chatterji (IISER-Pune)","Self-assembly of ordered cylindrical nano-structures: A theoretical investigation of experimental results.","Room 118 (Creativity Hall)  Ground Floor  Chemical Engineering Department","28 Mar 2013 - 17:00","28 Mar 2013 - 18:00","185"

Contractor's Talk","Start: 4 Apr 2013 - 17:00 End: 4 Apr 2013 - 18:00 Abstract:   Understanding the charging behaviour of a conducting polymer is important from the point of view of its use as a charge storage device. Potentiodynamic techniques such as step-  pulse- or  cyclic-voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy are some common techniques employed for the study of charging dynamics of conducting polymer films. Since the charging process involves several coupled dynamical steps  the  overall dynamics becomes so complex that decoupling of the overall processes into individual steps is very difficult and can often be ambiguous. One way to overcome this difficulty is to perform a suitable  redox reaction on the conducting polymer film  under steady state condition. By monitoring steady state current as a function of the electrode potential  for a fixed composition of the electrolyte  it is  possible to obtain an insight into the nature of the charge storage characteristics of the film  as shown in this work. It is possible to study the energy state of the stored charge by studying the shifts in  the reaction equilibria in different ranges of electrode potential. Using this technique  it is possible to elucidate the energy band structure of the charge storage in the polymer.    As a test case  polyaniline film was chosen as the substrate. To keep the analysis simple  we needed to choose an elementary one-step redox reaction. For the present study  we chose a redox system involving  ferrous-ferric ions. Some experiments were also performed on the redox reaction of quinhydrone.    We observed five distinct energy bands in which charge is stored in  polyaniline. The transition potentials as well as band energies were quantified using this method. These transition potentials coincided with those observed by other authors using Electron Spin Resonance  Spectroscopy and Raman Spectroscopy. Both the systems studied yielded identical energy bands indicating that our method does not depend on the system chosen and is universal.","webmaster","3 Apr 2013 - 08:43","3 Apr 2013 - 08:46","Seminar/Talk","Asfiya Q.

In the present work  advanced  applications and configurations of reactive distillation for various  esterification reactions are explored and investigated. The production of 2-ethylhexyl acetate by esterification of  2-ethylhexanol with acetic acid in the presence of ion exchange resin  (Amberlyst-15) as catalyst  is investigated in a RD column using toluene  as an entrainer. Toluene helps in removing water efficiently from the  reactive zone and maintains the reactive zone temperature below the  thermal stability limit of the catalyst. Experiments as well as  simulations show that quantitative conversion is achievable using the  proposed entrainer based reactive distillation process. The effect of  different parameters on the conversion is studied through simulations.  The proposed RD process is compared with the conventional process that  uses homogeneous /p/TSA as a catalyst and it is shown that the proposed  process is more energy efficient and less capital intensive. Further in this work  study is done to investigate the potential of  reactive distillation for the valorization of fusel oil i.e. a mixture  of alcohols obtained as a distillery waste. It is proposed to react  these alcohols with acetic acid and separate the esters in pure form. It  is expected that reactive distillation (RD)  which is a proven  intensification strategy for esterification of individual alcohols can  also be a promising option for simultaneous esterification of all the  alcohols in fusel oil.  To evaluate its feasibility and design a unit on  large scale  kinetic and phase equilibrium models are necessary.  Reaction kinetics is experimentally investigated for all the  esterification and /trans-/esterification reactions of the different  constituents of fusel oil with acetic acid in the presence of cation  exchange resin  Amberlyst-15. A unified  Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) model is proposed for the  reacting system consisting of mixture of all the alcohols and the  experimental data is used to estimate the model parameters. The  predictions are in agreement with the experimental data for individual  alcohols as well as their mixtures. Experiments are performed in a  laboratory scale reactive distillation column and a simulation model is  validated. Different process alternatives exist and these are compared  based on the total energy consumption as the criterion. The potentially  cost-effective alternatives are identified.","webmaster","25 Apr 2013 - 08:20","25 Apr 2013 - 08:21","Seminar/Talk",,"Studies in Reactive Distillation for the synthesis of Carboxylic  Esters","Room 118 (Creativity Hall)  Ground Floor  Chemical Engineering Department","25 Apr 2013 - 17:00","25 Apr 2013 - 18:00","185"

In this talk  I will  discuss material characterization of these contrast agents that includes  determination of rheological properties of a contrast microbubble’s  encapsulation using one set of in vitro experiments  followed by model  validation using another set. I will offer a hierarchical approach with  increasing sophistication in constitutive modeling of the encapsulation  as warranted by the determining experiments and underlying physics. A  new model for the dissolution of microbubbles will be presented. I will  discuss subharmonic signals used for noninvasive monitoring of  organ-level blood pressure  and explain their unusual behaviors in sharp  contrast to “plausible expectations” and classical bubble dynamics results. I will also briefly discuss specifically targeted and cytosolic delivery  of cancer drugs from “echogenic liposomes”. Time permitting  I will provide an overview of other research efforts at  our lab. It includes direct numerical simulation of multiphase  flowsemulsions of deformable viscous and viscoelastic drops  capsules  (encapsulated by a hyperelastic membrane)  their rheology  adhesion and  migration of leukocytes on active substrates in presence of  receptor-ligand bindingas well as ultrasound mediated bone fracture  healing and cancer therapy.","webmaster","16 Jul 2013 - 12:07","16 Jul 2013 - 12:10","Seminar/Talk","Kausik Sarkar  Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering George Washington University","Encapsulated Microbubbles: From echocardiography to noninvasive blood pressure monitoring and targeted drug delivery","Creativity Hall (Room 118)  Chemical Engineering","18 Jul 2013 - 17:00","18 Jul 2013 - 17:00","185"

However  NOx abatement is a challenging task  under excess air conditions due to which alternate technologies for NOx reduction are in  focus. One of these technologies is the NOx storage and reduction (NSR). It consists of two  cyclic steps which occur on a lean NOx trap (LNT) catalyst: NOx storage during the fuel lean  phase and NOx reduction/regeneration during the rich phase. A global kinetic model for  NOx storage and reduction for the case of anaerobic regeneration with hydrogen was  developed. The existence of two different types of BaO sites on the catalyst was proposed. The  effluent concentrations and concentration fronts of the reactants and products within the monolith  were predicted by the model  providing insight into the mechanisms of regeneration and  storage. It was shown that the NH3 formed upstream reacted with the stored NOx downstream of the H2  front. An analysis of the H2 concentration front showed the presence of more stored NOx in the  front of the reactor. A simplified crystallite scale model was combined with a reactor scale  model to study the effect of Pt dispersion and temperature on the regeneration behaviour of a LNT  catalyst. The experimental data was explained by the localized stored NOx gradients in  the BaO phase. The model predicted that the highest amount of NH3 was produced by the low  dispersion catalyst at high temperatures  by the high dispersion catalyst at low temperatures   and by the intermediate dispersion catalyst at intermediate temperatures  which was consistent  with the experimental data. It was shown that NH3 is formed under conditions where NOx  spill-over to the Pt/BaO interface is the rate limiting process. This finding could be used to  design catalysts for getting the desired NH3 levels in the system.","webmaster","22 Jul 2013 - 11:46","10 Sep 2013 - 10:34","Seminar/Talk","Divesh Bhatia  R & D Division Nalco Water India Ltd.","Kinetic and modeling studies of lean NOx traps","Creativity Hall (Room 118)  Chemical Engineering","25 Jul 2013 - 17:00","25 Jul 2013 - 18:00","185"

Abstract : The constituents of an energized granular mixture tend to separate due  to difference in their size and/or density. Segregation  in spite of  being an important and seemingly simple phenomenon  is difficult to  explain both because of the interplay of various parameters governing  the segregation process  and because granular materials do not have a  well understood constitutive law. In this work  I will present  experimental and numerical investigation of a novel segregation process   wherein a granular mixture separates axially when shaken horizontally in  a Christmas-tree shaped channel consisting of several concatenated  trapezoidal sections. The channel is kept horizontal so that its base  aligns normal to gravity. The channel ends are closed. A binary mixture  kept in the channel segregates to its opposite ends upon shaking. The  segregation process is extremely robust and is able to separate all  varieties of food grains. Even multiple component granular mixtures  consisting of more than two kinds of grains have been successfully  segregated. In addition  I will discuss scaling of granular temperature  with peak vibrational velocity in vibrated granular media  and present  how our study reconciles previous disparate experimental  computational  and theoretical results.

Abstract : Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a meshless particle based Lagrangian numerical method that has been in development for the past  three decades. Commensurate with the exponential growth in computational  power  SPH has been increasingly applied to solve problems of greater  complexity in fluid mechanics  solid mechanics  interfacial flows   astrophysics and in interdisciplinary problems like fluid-structure  interaction  granular flows  fracture mechanics  solidification etc.  Incompressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (ISPH)  a variant of SPH   solves for a pressure field to achieve incompressibility as opposed to  the original SPH method  which uses a stiff equation of state to achieve  the same. ISPH is known to reduce spurious pressure fluctuations and  also computational time. In this talk  several new improvements on the  existing ISPH algorithm to simulate free surface flows will be  presented. We will also discuss the various challenges encountered in implementing the ISPH algorithm in a computer program. We employ the proposed ISPH free  surface algorithm to simulate water entry of projectiles. The flow  features and energy transfer due to entry of solid bodies of different  shapes  density and initial spin into water have been studied. By performing a theoretical analysis  we demonstrate that although SPH  is known to be inherently mass conserving  due to finite timestep  updates  it does not conserve volume. This is equally applicable to  other meshfree particle based methods as well. We propose a novel  deformation-gradient based algorithm for better volume conservation.  Finally  we will show that combining the ISPH algorithm proposed in this  study with the weakly compressible SPH  simulations involving  compressible-incompressible two fluid systems can also be performed.","webmaster","16 Jul 2015 - 12:30","21 Jul 2015 - 16:09","Seminar/Talk","Dr.Gourav Tomar  Professor  Department of Mechanical Engg.

Despite their critical importance and global  degradation  most engineering decisions  including those based on  methods meant to enhance sustainability  ignore these essential  resources. Thus  despite the growing interest in sustainability at  corporations  governments  universities  and among consumers  making  decisions without accounting for the goods and services that provide our  life support could lead to perverse outcomes. Our research is expanding  the boundary of Process Systems Engineering to address the challenges of  sustainable engineering by including economic and ecological systems.  This talk will focus on the challenges in accounting for the role played  by nature in supporting industrial activities  and in designing  nature-inspired networks of technological and ecological systems. The  use of life cycle assessment methods for guiding engineering decisions  will be demonstrated by applications to emerging products such as  polymer nanocomposites. Ecologically-based LCA will be introduced as a  way to consider the direct and indirect role of ecosystem services in  supporting industrial activities  and the unique insight provided by  this approach will be demonstrated by application to various  transportation fuels. For designing sustainable technological systems   the approach of Eco-Synergy Design will be introduced. This approach  expands the concept of unit operations to ecological processes to design  integrated networks of technological and ecological systems that aim to  mimic nature by closing all material loops and maximizing network  efficiency. Such nature-inspired biomimetic design of techno-ecological  networks permits exploration of a much larger design space than possible  with the traditional engineering approach  while encouraging design and  innovation within ecological constraints. This approach will be  illustrated by application to systems such as a suburban home  waste  management  and the biofuel life cycle.

This  particular  phenomenon  often  leads  to  material   failure  and  thus  obtaining  a   microscopic understanding of this process becomes very imp   ortant.  In recent work  we have   studied  the  instability  responsible  for  this  process  from  a   microscopic  point  of  view  using   athermal  quasi-static simulations of binary Lennard-Jon   es glasses  and continuum solid  me-   chanics.   The  talk  will  start  with  an  introduction  to  some  of  t   he basic  ideas  in  amorphous   elasticity & plasticity.  The importance of non-affine motion     the notion of elementary plastic   instabilities in the stress-strain response and the connec   tion between non-affine response and   eigenvalues & eigen-modes of the Hessian matrix will be disc   ussed briefly. Data obtained from   numerical  simulations  show  that  the  non-affine displacement   field  associated  with  a  plastic   instability undergoes a qualitative shift   changing from  a   quadrupolar field to a shear band   as we strain the material.  We will understand this transitio   n using the theoretical formalism   of  Eshelby inclusion(s).  An expression  for  the elastic  ener   gy of   N   inclusions  dispersed  and   oriented randomly in an elastic medium subject to a global lo   ading will be obtained.  It will   then be proven analytically that at sufficiently large values   of strain  a state of minimal energy   is when each of these   N   inclusions are equi-aligned and lie on a line oriented at 45   ◦   to the   global compressive axes.  It will be seen that this highly cor   related arrangement of inclusions    is responsible for organising the non-affine flow into a shear b   and.

Krishnakumar's Talk","Start: 12 Aug 2013 - 17:00 End: 12 Aug 2013 - 18:00 Abstract: Cyanobacteria are a group of photosynthetic prokaryotes that inhabit in diverse ecosystems with simple oxygen (O2) evolving mechanism similar to that in higher plants. They are believed to be responsible for the creation of oxygenic atmosphere on earth and are credited with 20-30% of the global photosynthesis currently. Cyanobacteria use light energy from the sunlight to fix atmospheric CO2 and convert it into energy rich sugar molecules for their growth  development and metabolic process. Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142  a non-heterocystous diazotrophic unicellular organism is one amongst the photosynthetic cyanobacterial community known well to perform both oxygenic photosynthesis and oxygen-sensitive nitrogenfixation temporally. This organism has extraordinary metabolic capabilities and is reported to produce higher amount of hydrogen (H2) under nitrogen fixing conditions. However  commercial considerations in growing this type cultures typically demand high cell density cultivations  which usually result in photo-limitation or photo-inhibition due to self-shading and uneven light distribution at high cell growth. A potential remedy would be culturing these cells under turbulent condition  which could alleviate such problems as a result of flashing light effect and cyclic movement of cells between light and dark zones. However  introducing turbulence along with aeration in reactor vessel can increase the oxygen tension in the media  which may affect nitrogen fixation and growth under nitrogen fixing conditions. We demonstrate the robustness and metabolic potential of Cyanothece 51142 at nitrogen fixing conditions through analyzing the online exhaust gas CO2 and O2 profiles under the influence of varying the agitation rates. From this study  we ascertain that the agitation speed at 600 rpm in stirred vessel provide optimal growth for this organism than the conventional shake flask and flat panel bioreactor studies. Further  Cyanothece 51142 tend to oscillate between day and night time metabolisms in response to light/dark (LD) or continuous light (LL) cycles  we therefore investigate the periodicity  behavioral pattern and robustness of free-run metabolic oscillations in tandem with gene expression studies under prolonged LL condition. We show that Cyanothece 51142 exhibit ~11h period sustained oscillations under extended LL condition  with fair synchronization between the online exhaust gas profiles and the results of biochemical and gene expression analysis. We also develop and demonstrate a novel functional re-annotation tool called “SHARP” (Systematic  Homology-based Automated Re-annotation for Prokaryotes) to predict the Gene-Protein-Reaction (GPR) associations based on distant context-specific sequence similarities and probabilistic optimization approach  predominantly from cyanobacterial species. The predicted GPR associations using SHARP led to the identification of several important pathways which can provide new directions in performing metabolic engineering studies to produce useful products.

Absorption accompanied by reaction is also the subject of classical multiphase gas-liquid reactions wherein  reaction takes place between the liquid substrate and the dissolved gas. However  an opposite case of reactive stripping wherein  reaction taking place in the vapor phase between the stripped-off component and the gas  is rare.  An example of such reactive stripping process is hydrogen-water exchange used for the separation of hydrogen isotopes.  The isotope exchange reaction is carried out in a trickle bed reactor (TBR) filled with a wet-proofed or hydrophobic catalyst. The TBR is commonly known as the catalytic chemical exchange (CE) column in which hydrogen and liquid water are contacted in countercurrent mode over the catalyst bed to transfer deuterium from liquid water to hydrogen through exchange reaction that takes place in the gas phase. In the present work  a pilot scale counter-current trickle bed reactor (TBR)  packed with an in-house developed water-repellent catalyst  is investigated for deuterium exchange between water and hydrogen  to be used for the production of heavy water. The reactant i.e. heavy water (HDO)  from liquid phase is stripped by the gas phase wherein  it undergoes an equilibrium limited exchange reaction with hydrogen over a solid catalyst. A two phase mathematical model is developed incorporating reaction kinetics  mass transfer resistances and dispersion in liquid phase flow to simulate the reactor performance. Model parameters such as kinetic rate constant  mass transfer coefficient etc. were determined by independent experiments. The reactor model is then experimentally validated by performing reactions in pilot scale column. The validated model is further used to arrive at a suitable design for the desired performance.

Abstract :  Biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils  animal fats and acid oil using heterogeneous/homogeneous acid/ base catalyst.   In the present work  synthesis of biodiesel is carried out in three different type of reactor viz. fixed bed reactor  batch reactor and microreactor. The process for the production of biodiesel can be intensified significantly by employing a heterogeneous catalyst. In the present work a heterogeneous catalyst  ZnO/ZSM-5  is used that promotes both  esterification and transesterification  simultaneously. The synthesis of biodiesel was carried out in a fixed bed reactor using sunflower oil and  jatropha oil. The catalyst was used in the form of cylindrical pellets having 6 mm ID and 8-10 mm length. The conversions higher than 90% were realized for both TG and FFA  typically at 200 0C  and  molar ratio of 6:1 for a residence time of 40 gm cat/(ml/min). The transesterification of sunflower oil with methanol is investigated with homogeneous catalyst. It is a two phase reaction. The reaction was carried out in a batch reactor with independent stirring of both phases  keeping interface flat. The intrinsic kinetics of the reaction is fast and limited by mass transfer. The progress of the reaction greatly depends on the speed of agitation and the interfacial area. Spontaneous emulsion was observed with sudden rise of interfacial area and reaction rate. It was observed that apart from agitation speed  the changing composition of the phases plays an important role to reduce the interfacial tension that causes spontaneous emulsion. Transesterification of sunflower oil with methanol using homogeneous catalyst has been  studied in three different types of microreactors.. Effects of temperature  contact time and feed molar ratio on the conversion of triglyceride (TG) have been studied. In some cases conversion of TG is not found to change monotonically with change in flowrate. Flow patterns are observed using a high speed camera  in an attempt to explain this seemingly unusual trend in some cases.  The results from the experiments conducted in this study indicate that it is possible to get very high TG conversion (>95%) with residence time less than 2 minutes Venue : Room 149  Chemical Engg.

No. 118  Ground floor  Chemical Engg. Dept. Abstract:  Rare events leading to phenotypic variation in a population  of genetically identical cells is a recurring theme in current  biological research. Recent research indicates that such `non-genetic  individuality' can be driven by the intrinsic stochasticity of gene  expression. Correspondingly there is a need to develop analytical  approaches for modeling fluctuations and rare events in stochastic gene  expression. In this talk  I will discuss analytical approaches developed by my  group for stochastic models of gene expression.  By developing a mapping  to systems analyzed in queueing theory  we derive analytical results  characterizing mRNA and protein distributions for general kinetic  schemes of gene expression. For models with Poisson arrivals of mRNAs   we develop a novel approach that leads to exact analytical results for  protein distributions. We combine approaches from queueing theory and  non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to characterize large deviations  in activity fluctuations for general models of gene expression with  promoter-based regulation.

Seminar by Saeikh Zaffar Hassan","Start: 26 Sep 2013 - 17:00 End: 26 Sep 2013 - 18:00 Abstract: Biodiesel is produced by esterification of fatty acids or trans-esterification of glycerides or the former followed by the latter for low-cost feed-stocks containing free fatty acids (FFA).  Typically  one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) experiments are performed to study the effects of process parameters on kinetics of biodiesel production. However  statistically designed experiments have advantages over OFAT experiments: the latter require more number of experiments than the former to obtain same amount of information; the latter cannot detect interactions between the parameters and may miss optimal settings of the parameters. The overall aim of our work is to understand in detail the parametric effects on the kinetics of the esterification and the trans-esterification reactions  for biodiesel synthesis from low-cost feed-stocks  using orthogonal array design of experiments and its properties with the help of Taguchi approach. Theoretically  equilibrium constant (Keq) depends on temperature only but reported measurements for esterification reactions show that it also depends on reactant concentration and amount of catalyst. The sensitivity-analysis of Keq showed that Keq is indeed a function of temperature only and not of molar ratio (MR) of the reactants and catalyst loading; reported dependency of Keq on reactants concentrations and catalyst loadings is due to errors in analysis of equilibrium composition. Dependency of the apparent rate constant on temperature  reactants concentration  and catalyst loading is also studied for H2SO4-catalyzed esterification-kinetics. Taguchi approach guided modification of second-order rate constant (SRC). The modified rate constant is shown to be independent of the reactants concentration unlike SRC. The rate law obtained with modified rate constant is consistent with the general mass action rate law reported by Blum and Luus (1964) and Pekar (2011). The modified rate constant is shown to be equivalent to Brønsted–Bjerrum relation; it is more general than the reported rate constants for esterification of fatty acids and predicts kinetics over a wide range of reaction parameters. Parametric-effects on esterification-kinetics of FFA are evaluated at different intervals of reaction. The relative effects of parameters for our system are also compared with the results of the detailed Taguchi analyses of esterification-kinetics data of published works for biodiesel synthesis. The relative parametric-effects on esterification-kinetics are found to be function of reaction duration. For KOH-catalyzed trans-esterification of sunflower oil with methanol  parametric-effects on the kinetics of biodiesel (FAME)  tri-glycerides (TG)  di-glycerides (DG)  and mono-glycerides (MG) are presented and discussed. Catalyst loading is found to be a significant parameter for FAME  TG  and DG and insignificant for MG. Temperature is insignificant for TG and DG reduction  but it has an important influence in the minimisation of MG. The combination of parameters which yielded ~95% of FAME with reasonable purity is 0.5 wt% KOH  50 °C  and 7 MR.

Chemotaxis is the biased migration of microorganisms to reach high nutrient concentrations and escape from noxious substances to ensure optimal growth and survival conditions. The chemotaxis phenomenon has been studied extensively in Escherichia coli  which achieves the biased motion by altering the rotational direction of its flagella. Counter-clockwise (CCW) rotation as viewed from the flagella end of the cell results in a motion called run  whereas clockwise (CW) rotation leads to tumbling of the bacteria. By modulating the duration of motor bias  and therefore the duration of runs  the bacteria achieve a net motion towards favorable chemicals or away from repellents. The regulation of the motor bias is achieved through a well-characterized signaling pathway  which involves sensing of the ligand through a membrane sensor  response through a signaling pathway and adaptation to the new environment. The current understanding of the molecular basis for chemotaxis comes from characterization of the high-abundance receptors  namely Tar and Tsr  which are responsible for sensing the amino acids  asparate and serine  respectively. Apart from the Tar and Tsr receptors  E. coli senses its environment through three low-abundance receptors  of which the Trg receptor is used to detect glucose. While detailed studies have focused on the molecular mechanism of sensing and adaptation via the Trg receptor  the latter is yet to be characterized in terms of the phenotypic response  namely  run speed and motor bias. In addition  glucose is also sensed through a Phospho Transferase System (PTS) sugar uptake mechanism  which operates in conjunction with the receptor mediated response through Trg. Our experiments investigate the response of the cell to glucose and a non-metabolizable analogue of glucose. At steady state  both the motor bias and the run speed vary with the ligand concentration suggesting an imperfect adaptation. When exposed to a gradient  the bias and the run speed are modulated to achieve drift velocities that are much higher than those achieved through the modulation of the bias alone. A strain lacking the Trg sensor exhibits run speeds much lower than that observed for the wild type strain in motility buffer suggesting that the Trg sensor influences the motor characteristics. We measure individual contributions of the two mechanisms on the run speed and the motor bias and show that the chemotactic response of a WT strain to glucose is the sum of contributions from the two mechanisms (Trg sensing and PTS). The CW bias and the mean run speed varies with ligand concentration indicating not only an imperfect adaptation but also a modulation of run speed. The main implication of our study is that E. coli modulates the motor characteristics  not only by varying both the duration of run and tumble  but also the run speed to affect chemotaxis and thereby efficiently sample its nutritionally rich environment.

The copolymers exhibit pH sensitivity and thermoreversible gelation at physiological temperatures. The cationic multiblock copolymers exhibit complexation with DNA and serve as excellent gene therapy vectors for cancer therapies. Our studies have shown that these polymeric vectors show sustained gene delivery and selective transfection in cancer cells versus non-cancer cells.  Detailed mechanistic studies have shown that the selectivity arises due to intracellular differences in pH between cancer and normal cells. The anionic multiblock copolymers and their micelles also serve as excellent templates for biomineralization. These hierarchically self-assembling copolymers in conjunction with mineralization proteins/peptides  form bioinspired self-assembled nanocomposites  including magnetic nanocomposites. The novel injectable insitu-forming nanocomposites show mechanical properties similar to that of native cartilage  and are being investigated for cartilage rescue to prevent post-traumatic osteo-arthritis.

The first part of this talk focuses on giving an industrial perspective on Advanced Process Control (APC). While APC techniques have been successfully applied in petrochemical and allied sectors  these have found rather modest success in upstream Oil and Gas. Field experiences with using simple logic-based control and static model-based control will be presented. Finally  the challenges and opportunities in applying APC solutions in non-traditional industries will be discussed. The second part of this talk will focus on application of Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) for control of distributed parameter systems. ADP is a computationally feasible method for online optimal control of process systems. The aim of ADP is to develop a ""Value Function"" (also called ""cost-to-go function"") that characterises desirability of the system state  with respect to the objective function. Use of ADP for large dimensional state-space is challenging due to ""curse of dimensionality"" -- a term used to indicate exponential growth in computational requirement with increasing state dimension. Model reduction techniques are used to reduce the state dimension. Both model-based and model-free ADP is demonstrated. About the Speaker: Dr. Niket Kaisare completed his B.Chem.Engg from UDCT (currently ICT-Mumbai) and PhD from Georgia Institute of Technology  both in Chemical Engineering.

Most of the failed drugs are being eliminated at the Phase II or Phase III of clinical trial. The drugs which are getting discontinued so far  though clear these rigorous trials are being discontinued in the long run  due to their associated toxicities such as renal failure  liver accumulation  poor bioavailability etc. This is where the modern techniques of nanotechnology play a vital role; with the scope to reformulate the discontinued and/or cytotoxic molecule by improving its efficiency and reduction in side effect related toxicity. Most small molecule drugs have short blood circulation time and hence it reduces the uptake rate by tumor tissue. In cancer chemotherapy  cytostatic drugs damage both malignant and normal cells. Thus a delivery strategy that selectively targets the malignant cells is very much needed. One example of this is the blood-ocular barrier. Due to the complexity of eye  the membranes present in it are selective to almost every foreign materials used as drug carriers. The problem becomes more prominent for posterior eye diseases. Retinoblastoma  being one such disease in retina still cannot be cured with traditional drug carriers. Carboplatin is one of the most effective anticancer agent after its analogue highly toxic Cisplatin and is effective in a wide variety of cancer such as non small cell lung cancer  ovarian cancer and intra-ocular retinoblastoma. Also  it is the only effective drug used in systemic chemotherapy for intra-ocular retinoblastoma. After systemic injection  Carboplatin is readily excreted from body through urinary excretion  where ~50% drug is cleared within 24 hours and hence the therapeutic dose cannot be obtained with a single injection  which necessitates the use of multiple injections in chemotherapy and in turn severe side effects such as renal failure  hepatotoxicity  myelosuppression  etc. We hypothesized and experimentally validated that incorporation of hydrophilic carboplatin inside hydrophobic PMMA nanomatrix during thermally induced radical polymerization gives high drug encapsulation efficiency  increases the circulation time inside eye  improves its (plausible) transport to the retina via vitreous and provides a high therapeutic concentration in the posterior part of eye by sustained release from nanoparticle  if injected locally. Briefly  following periocular injection in rats  the intravitreal concentration of nanoparticulate carboplatin (NPC) was nearly 4 fold higher than the commercially available carboplatin (CAC) concentrations in all the animals as measured by ICP-AES. Animals showed no sign of toxicity in the nearby tissues with undetectable concentrations in blood up to 42 days. Overall  the mean vitreous concentration of NPC was greater than CAC in all days. Following our successful attempt in establishment of enhanced intravitreal concentration of carboplatin with NPC compared to CAC in rats  the study was extended to human. Objective of the work was to study the tissue safety and intra-ocular distribution of posterior subtenon’s (PST) injected NPC in humans  for advanced intra-ocular retinoblastoma  as a clinical model.  Results indicated an increased facilitated trans-scleral transport of the nanoparticulate form of the drug  without any associated ocular tissue damage or systemic side effects  post a PST injection. The high concentration achieved in retina and vitreous may be clinically useful for adjunctive treatment of advanced intra-ocular retinoblastoma. Also  to achieve active targeting of carboplatin  we have reported some novel biocompatible multifunctional core-shell nanoparticles of polyacrylic acid  bearing surface conjugated pendant carboxylic acid and amine groups with enhanced hydrophilicity and investigated their ability to carry and deliver Carboplatin in various cancer cells in a target specific manner  with detail cellular uptake and efficiency studies.

Picker's Talk","Start: 28 Nov 2013 - 17:00 End: 28 Nov 2013 - 18:00 Abstract: With the realisation of the human genome project  there has been a paradigm shift in thinking. No longer are we focused on decoding the genome but rather on using it. Superficially  whole genome sequencing for everybody would seem to be the goal but reading the sequence is not the same as understanding it. Pitfalls in interpretation suggest a more refined approach is needed.  About the Speaker: Dr. Jonathan Picker is an Assistant Professor in Paediatrics at the Harvard Medical School and Consultant at Boston Children's Hospital.  With 25 years’ experience in Paediatrics and genetics  Dr. Picker has focused his career very much across the interface of clinical care  applied research and education. This is reflected in his academic position at Harvard Medical School as an Asst. Professor in clinical expertise with special interest in research in the department of Paediatrics. Dr. Picker’s research has crossed the span of assessing diagnostic tools in genetics to descriptive analysis of rare disorders to molecular neuroscience. His primary focus has been on the genetics underlying intellect and behaviour. This interest has been very much applied to clinical care and Dr. Picker has developed a number of innovative programs and web-based tools to assist primary care practitioners and their patients understand and use knowledge of rare disorders to significantly improve their ability to improve care. Indeed newborn screening protocols for inborn errors of metabolism developed by him for the New England Consortium of metabolic programs were used as a template from which the NIH developed national “ACT sheet” guidelines for paediatricians throughout the United States. This experience consequently was utilised when Dr. Picker was chosen to chair the National Fragile X Clinic and Research Consortium’s clinical committee to lead the development of accessible guidelines to help both physicians and families with the wide range of complex issues. Dr. Picker is now focused on using his wide experience of genetics to improve the quality of care for those affected by genetic disorders. While this may seem esoteric it is important to bear in mind that while individually rare  collectively  rare genetic syndromes affect 1 in 25 of the population and  generally  genes play a central role in over half of all paediatric admissions to hospitals; yet poor understanding of genetics is deleteriously impacting patients. In addition he continues to be involved in research and clinical care as well as being the director of Harvard’s fragile X program at Boston Children’s Hospital. Dr. Picker has degrees in BMedBio (commend) IN Genetics and MBChB in Medicine from Aberdeen University  UK and MSc in Genetics & Biochemistry and PhD in Molecular Biology from Newcastle University  UK.

This talk will discuss a strategy for creating model PNCs in which spherical nanoparticles (NPs) are uniformly dispersed in high molecular weight (Mw) entangled polymers. In particular  by carefully harnessing favorable enthalpic interactions between particle-tethered and host polymers we show that particle-particle aggregation can be completely avoided. Investigation of the mechanical properties of these model PNCs reveal that nanoparticles have profound effects on their host polymer’s physical properties and dynamics on essentially all timescales. The talk will specifically consider the effect of surface and geometric confinement and constraint release processes induced by particle motion induce on dynamics of entangled melts. We show  for example  that progressive addition of NPs to polymers induce additional constraints for the polymer chain motion than typically observed in entangled melts  leading to an earlier discovery of the confinement tube. On long timescales  NPs appear to promote an early onset of terminal relaxation of the polymer chains for high Mw hosts. At high particle content  particle constraints can induce glassy behavior in the host polymer. Investigation of nanoparticle dynamics reveal that as the nanoparticle size D  is progressively increased above the tube diameter of the host polymer (a)  particles undergo a transition from normal diffusion to hyperdiffusive relaxation dynamics. A local viscosity model capable of explaining these observations is discussed and the results compared with findings from a recently proposed scaling/theoretical model for hopping of NPs in polymers.

However   their use is currently limited by the conversion of large biopolymers -  cellulose  hemicellulose and lignin linked via stable covalent bonds  which are hard to breakdown and produce chemicals (or fuels)  selectively. In the CatBioChem group (Catalysis for Bio- Chemicals  Group) led by Dr Akshat Tanksale  the focus of the research is  to deconstruct the biomass polymers and selectively make platform  chemicals for further conversion into value added chemicals and fuels.  Different strategies are being adopted to achieve this  including   enzymatic deconstruction of raw biomass into individual biopolymers   heterogeneous catalytic conversion of cellulose and hemicellulose into  platform intermediate chemicals via hydrolysis and gasification routes   followed conversion of these platform chemicals into fuels and  value added chemicals. In this seminar  overview of the group research  program will be presented  with details on couple of projects on  cellulose conversion into sorbitol via sequential  hydrolysis-hydrogenation reaction to produce sorbitol and reactive flash  volatilisation of cellulose into tar free synthesis gas. /Hydrolysis-Hydrogenation of Cellulose into Sorbitol - /Sorbitol is a  polyol which is widely regarded as one of the key platform chemicals  which can be utilised for producing alternative fuels like hydrogen  or value added chemicals. We have developed a heterogeneous catalytic  pathway to convert cellulose into polyols using low cost nickel based  catalysts supported on alumina and dealuminated Beta-zeolite supports.  In the first step  water soluble oligomers of cellulose were produced by  milling acidulated microcrystalline cellulose  followed by conversion of  these oligomers into polyols over promoted nickel supported catalyst.  Selective yields in excess of 90% is achieved in less than 1 h reaction  time in a batch reactor.  /Reactive Flash Volatilisation of Cellulose into Synthesis Gas -  /Reactive Flash Volatilisation is a catalytic gasification process which  utilises high carbon space velocity and mass flow rate with oxygen and  steam as gasification agents. In this research  we aim to develop active  and selective nickel based catalysts for reactive flash volatilisation  of cellulose to produce tunable H2:CO ratio and tar free synthesis gas  in less than 50 ms reaction time. Gas yields in excess of 85% is  achieved without any tar formation with Rhenium promoted Nickel catalyst  at 750°C.  *Bio:*  Dr. Akshat Tanksale is a research Group Leader and member of the  academic staff at the Department of Chemical Engineering   Monash University  Australia.

219,"4907","Sathish K Sukumaran's Talk","Start: 12 Dec 2013 - 17:00 End: 12 Dec 2013 - 18:00 *Abstract : *  When fluids flow  the tangential component of the velocity is assumed to  be continuous at phase boundaries (the no-slip boundary condition).  Experimental work on Newtonian fluids  especially in confined  geometries  has cast doubt on this assumption and the situation is  currently unclear. For non-Newtonian fluds  such as polymer melts  shear  dependent slip has been observed during flow in contact with a solid  wall (wall slip). Evidence for slip at the interface between immiscible  non-Newtonian fluids (interfacial slip) also exists. However  even when  compared to wall slip  interfacial slip remains poorly understood and  will be the focus of this talk. Studies that use only rheological data  to deduce the slip velocity usually involve applying a shear deformation  to a stack of parallel multilayers. In order to understand slip in the  context of polymer extrusion  we have investigated slip at the interface  between two immiscible polymer melts undergoing pressure driven flow  through a capillary die. To enable the measurement of slip velocity at  the polymer/polymer interface we have adapted the Mooney method  a  method usually used to study wall slip. Using the method  we measured  the dependence of the interfacial slip velocity on the interfacial shear  stress for cylindrical core-sheath samples of Polypropylene and  Polystyrene. In agreement with prior work on multilayer sandwiches  we  found two distinct power-law regimes in the relationship between the  interfacial slip velocity and the interfacial shear stress. The  power-law exponent changes from a value of approximately 3 at low shear  stress values to approximateley 2 at high shear stresses. We then  investigated the effect of varying the temperature on the slip velocity  and explore the consequences of time-temperature superposition for the  two polymers. Interestingly  the interfacial slip velocities can be  superposed using the WLF parameters of one of the polymers but not the  other. Finally  if time permits  I will discuss the connection  if any   between slip at the interface between the two polymers and the roughness  observed at the polymer/polymer interface.

He received his education at the IIT in Chennai (B.Tech  Metallurgical Eng.  1995) and at the University of Cincinnati  USA (Ph.D  Materials Science and Eng.  2002). During his post-doctoral fellowship at the Max-Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz  Germany he jointly developed a method to analyse the topological state of entangled polymer liquids (Primitive Path Analysis). He followed this with a stay at the University of Leeds  UK  where he performed molecular simulations of entangled polymers and on establishing the use of software correlators. There  he also developed novel tube models for entangled bidisperse blends. He has been at Yamagata University since 2009. His current research efforts are mainly directed at two areas. One is on the dynamics and rheology of entangled polymer liquids  using mainly computer simulations and analytical theory. Areas of interest include hierarchical modelling of entangled polymer dynamics using simulations (molecular dynamics  primitive path analysis  Brownian dynamics of slip-link models etc.) and analytical theory (tube models). For his work on entangled polymer dynamics  he was awarded the Encouragement Award of the Society of Rheology  Japan in 2013. More recently  he is also leading an experimental endeavour to understand slip at polymer/polymer interfaces using mainly rheological and optical techniques. Current interests include methods to measure interfacial slip  physical understanding of the phenomena and applications in polymer processing  especially processing instabilities.","webmaster","9 Dec 2013 - 12:18","9 Dec 2013 - 12:24","Seminar/Talk","Prof. Sathish K Sukumaran.Ryohei Komuro  Masataka Sugimoto and Kiyohito Koyama Graduate School of Science and Engineering Yamagata University  Japan","Slip at the interface between immiscible polymer melts","Creativity Hall (Room 118)  Chemical Engineering","12 Dec 2013 - 17:00","12 Dec 2013 - 18:00","185"

The electrical engineer is often concerned with  controlling the coherent state of light (as in a laser)  a mechanical  engineer might be more interested in controlling radiation from thermal  fluctuations while a physicist looks for ways to manipulate the  non-classical properties of light. We will describe different classes of  metamaterials (epsilon-near-zero  magnetic  hyperbolic and others) each  with its unique potential for controlling light-matter interaction. The main applications of such metamaterials will be presented ranging from thermophotovoltaics to quantum nanophotonics.

We do not need to reify it  and some of the philosophical problems that arise  when we do so  are not real problems. The processes involved in being conscious of the world are more likely to be distributed than to depend on just one region of the brain.

Detailed studies of the ordering of monolayers of long-chain n-alkanoic and n-alkanol monolayers at the water-vapor interface have demonstrated that rigid-rod all-trans ordering of the tail groups is maintained upon replacing the alcohol with a carboxylic acid headgroup. In contrast  at the water-hexane liquid-liquid interface we demonstrate that substitution of the -CH2OH with the -COOH head group produces a major conformational change of the tail group from disordered to ordered.  This is demonstrated by the electron density profiles of triacontanol (CH3(CH2)29OH) and triacontanoic acid (CH3(CH2)28COOH) monolayers at the water-hexane interface  as determined by X-ray reflectivity  measurements. Molecular dynamics simulations illustrate the presence of hydrogen bonding between the triacontanoic acid head groups that is likely responsible for the tail ordering. A simple free energy illustrates the interplay between the attractive hydrogen bonding and the ordering of the tail group.

Membranes operating with high separation  selectivities can cut down the cost of the thermally driven separation  processes such as distillation by up to 10-fold.1 2 Moreover  chemically  and thermally stable  high-throughput membranes are expected to open new  avenues for the process intensification and a wide-scale decentralized  operation. Inspired by this  we have been driven to develop synthetic  and engineering routes to design chemically and thermally stable  membranes that outperform the state-of-the-art-membranes in separation  selectivity as well as productivity (membrane permeance). With this  perspective  I will present our recent endeavors to develop the  nanoporous two-dimensional membranes which are the ultimate membranes  for the gas separation. I will discuss our recent advances in the  top-down and the bottom-up synthetic approaches  solvothermal  crystallization  the novel designs of high-throughput porous support   and the key challenges that still need to be overcome to develop the  next-generation membranes.3 4 5 6 References: 1.

Infection by  /Plasmodium falciparum/ is the major cause of malaria deaths. Recent  vaccine candidates attempt to block transmission of this parasite from  host to host  and invasion of cell types such as RBCs. Our research  focuses on developing a recombinant vaccine which can induce the  production of antibodies against the surface proteins of the parasite.  Antibodies against such surface proteins are expected to block  attachment of the parasite to RBCs  thus preventing invasion. In this work  a set of potential vaccine candidates has been chosen to develop an efficacious vaccine. They are /P. falciparum/ merozoite surface protein 1_19 (PfMSP1_19 )  4 (PfMSP4)  and 5 (PfMSP5). Production and recovery of such parasite surface proteins in most expression systems is difficult given that they are membrane proteins with extensive intramolecular linkages.

As primary producers they contribute significantly to the fixed carbon budget in terrestrial and marine environments. Thus  a broader understanding of their role in biogeochemistry is important particularly as the magnitude and rapidity of global environmental changes become pressing issues. Currently  there is a growing interest in cyanobacteria as a source of clean biofuels and specialty products. Although my research interests focus on basic questions ranging from the mechanisms of photoperception to molecular ecology  our approaches and results may have utility and relevance to applied fields as well.             I will discuss the unexpected diversity we have uncovered in microbial and phage populations in extreme environments and the mechanisms by which this diversity is maintained and evolves over relatively short time scales. Thus  the major priority in my research program is the use of genomic molecular and computational tools to probe diversity and adaptations within microbial communities. I would also like to bring in my longstanding interest and understanding of phototaxis into our thinking of how organisms exquisitely sense and move in response to light gradients and qualities.             Some of the questions we are poised to answer will be best approached by working with colleagues with complementary interests and new technologies. This strategy coupled with our recent ability to grow and manipulate some of these organisms should allow us to build a strong framework that provides a mechanistic understanding of interacting communities in the environment.

Bhatia's Talk","Start: 4 Apr 2014 - 17:00 Abstract: The understanding of the mechanism of water adsorption in the hydrophobic nanospaces of carbons is critical to many industrial processes for gas separation and water purification  and to emerging nanotechnologies for desalination  CO2 capture from flue gas  and separation by nanofluidic devices. While there have been numerous attempts at simulating water adsorption in hydrophobic carbons using idealized models of independent slit pores  only qualitative agreement with experiment has been achieved  and the answer to the difficult question of how water enters such spaces has remained elusive. Using grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations with a realistic model of a disordered hydrophobic carbon  we show that the key to the puzzle is the connectivity of the structure – overlooked by independent slit pore models. Our simulations and data confirm that significant amount of water adsorbs below the saturation pressure in purely hydrophobic nanopores  and it is demonstrated that this occurs only when pore entries are sufficiently large to allow the passage of stable hydrogen-bonded water clusters. We investigate the effect of pore connectivity through synthetic models of connected and unconnected slit pores  and show that the connectivity to narrow water-filled pores mediates the adsorption of water in large hydrophobic nanospaces. This unique feature is not observed for nonpolar or weakly polar gases (e.g. Ar or N2) at subcritical conditions  and explains why the Kelvin equation fails to estimate the condensation pressure for water. The results open the door for the design and tailoring of efficient adsorbents for CO2 capture  in which the co-adsorption of water vapour which saturates flue gas is inhibited.

Despite the development of various processes for liposome synthesis  the application is limited due to issues related to process complexity and scale-up. Hence there is an urgent need of an alternative technique that can be scaled up to industrial scale. To this end  we focus on the self assembly of lipid molecules leading to the formation of liposomes in the sub-100-nm range via microfluidics.  We describe a novel technique to synthesize monodisperse liposomes in the sub-100 nm size range using a packed bed of colloidal particles which could also be used to simultaneously encapsulate a drug. The methodology involves drying lipids dispersed in an organic solvent in a capillary packed with colloidal particles  which upon hydration with an aqueous buffer containing a drug  leads to liposome formation with simultaneous encapsulation of the drug. Our experiments show that the size of the liposome is independent of the particle size or  the pore size. The entrapment efficiency of the liposomes prepared by hydration using low volumes (~200 µl)of aqueous medium indicates 30% of its overall capacity. This makes the proposed process a promising technique for liposome synthesis. Finally  we describe an automated process based on the packed bed process for continuous production of liposomes using alternate plugs of lipid and buffer interspersed by flow of nitrogen gas. In the second part  we investigate the dewetting phenomenon leading to hole formation in solid supported lipid bilayers obtained via spin coating.  The study involved lipid films of four different lipids dispersed in ethanol and chloroform on glass substrate to investigate the role of the nature of lipid  solvent  and film thickness on the characteristic length scale and the number density of the holes. For a fixed solvent and rotation rate  the average size of the hole increased with dry film thickness while the number density decreased with the film thickness. However  the measured hole sizes are about an order of magnitude lower than that predicted by the spinodal dewetting theory. The length scale of the holes were greater in case of ethanol compared to chloroform though the predicted trends are opposite.  Our results indicate that despite the discrepancy the hole formation is primarily driven by the spinodal dewetting process.

The three-way  catalytic converter (TWC) is one such extensively used device in  automobiles to treat exhaust gas emissions. The main chemical reactions  occurring in the TWC are the oxidation of carbon monoxide and  hydrocarbons to CO_2 and H_2 O; and the reduction of nitrogen oxides to  N_2 . TWC employs metals Pt and Rh in various ratios as the catalyst.  The other specific aspect of TWC is that these catalyst metals are  present as pure metals and alloy formation is avoided. It is reported  that such a physical mixture of Pt and Rh exhibits synergistic NO  reduction activity. Though this system is widely studied in literature   the exact reason behind this synergism is not explicitly known. In this work we have explored this aspect with the help of microkinetic  model simulations and few experiments. The NO reduction system is  complicated due to multiple reducing agents and catalysts working  simultaneously. The reactions NO+CO  NO+H_2 and NO+CO+H_2 on single  metals Pt and Rh and bimetallic Pt+Rh catalysts in the form of physical  mixtures are studied by developing microkinetic models from literature  and CHEMKIN PRO^® simulations for Perfectly Stirred Reactor (PSR) model.  A few fixed bed experiments on NO+CO/ Pt+Rh system are also performed. The some of the important finding are as follows: The activity of the catalyst depends upon two aspects  the activation  energy required for NO dissociation and for the reaction between  reducing agent and adsorbed oxygen. From the microkinetic model for  NO+CO reaction  it is observed that CO_2 formation has almost same  activation energy on both Pt and Rh (~ 23 kcal/mol) but NO dissociation  activation energy is almost half on Rh (6kcal/mol) of that on Pt (13  kcal/mol). This explains why Rh is more active than Pt for NO+CO  reaction. When a physical mixture of Pt and Rh is used  the overall  activity is dominated by Rh. Similarly for NO+H_2 reaction  from the  microkinetic model  it is observed that activation energy for OH_S  formation (precursor for water) is low on Pt (8 kcal/mol) than on Rh (14  kcal/mol) and hence Pt is more active than Rh for NO+H_2 reaction. When  a physical mixture of Pt and Rh is used  the mixture activity is  dominated by Pt. When both CO and H_2 are present  then the H_2 acts as  the preferred reducing agent.

During the UCG process  a cavity is formed in the coal seam  when coal is converted to gaseous products. The rate of growth of this  cavity and its shape at any given time depends on the reactant gas flow  patterns  kinetics. It leaves us with a scope to investigate the  kinetics of the processes in UCG. Pyrolysis is an important step in the combustion and gasification of  coal  and its kinetics plays an important role in the design of  pertinent reactors. In this work  we have studied the kinetics of  pyrolysis of three Indian lignite samples via experiments and  mathematical modeling. Applicability of various kinetic models viz. the  single global reaction model  the consecutive reaction model and the  distributed activation energy model is evaluated. The kinetic parameters  of the models are estimated based on the experimental data. Kinetics of  the evolution of the volatile matter is studied independently by using a  specially designed fixed bed reactor and the relevant kinetic parameters  are estimated. Gasification of four Indian coals is carried out in a CO2 atmosphere   using a thermo gravimetric analyzer (TGA)  to determine the intrinsic  kinetics over a temperature range of 800-10500C with different partial  pressures of CO2. The applicability of three models viz. the volumetric  reaction model  the shrinking core model and the random pore model is  evaluated. Of these three models  the random pore model is found to be  the most suitable for all the coals considered in the current study. The  dependence of the reaction rate on the gas-phase partial pressures is  explained by the Langmuir - Hinshelwood model and the parameters for the  inhibition due to CO and CO2 are determined by performing experiments at  different partial pressures.. A one dimensional reaction diffusion model  is therefore developed in order to determine the diffusional resistance  in the coal particle  and values of diffusivity are estimated. Steam gasification of Indian coals is carried out in a fixed bed  reactor  to determine the intrinsic kinetics over a temperature range of  740-8300C with different partial pressures of steam. The applicability  of the random pore model is evaluated. The kinetic parameters are estimated.

The work  consists of three sections employing Monte Carlo (MC) simulation  techniques; first one is a study of structural properties of III-V  binary alloys  second one is a study of miscibility characteristics of  III-V and II-VI ternary alloys and the third one is a study of  structural properties of III-V and II-VI ternary alloys. The structural  properties of the III-V binary alloys (modelled using the Abell-Tersoff  potential) have been investigated using the standard Metropolis MC  algorithm in the isothermal isobaric ensemble at 300 K and 1 bar. Having  established  by comparison with experimental and molecular dynamics (MD)  simulation generated data from literature  that MC techniques can be  applied to predict structural properties of the binary III-V alloys with  reasonable accuracy  we studied the miscibility characteristics and  structural properties of the III-V and II-VI ternary alloys. The  miscibility diagrams (temperature as a function of composition at 1 bar)  of these ternary alloys (modelled using the valence force field (VFF)  potential)  determined in the work of this thesis using the transition  matrix Monte Carlo (TMMC) method in the isothermal isobaric semigrand (N    P   T   ξ2 ) ensemble are found to be asymmetric. MC simulations have  been performed in the isothermal isobaric semigrand (N   P   T   ξ2 )  ensemble to determine the lattice constants  nearest neighbour and next  nearest neighbour bond lengths  and bond angles at 300 K and 1 bar. We  have analyzed the variation of these properties with composition using  Z-plots and bond-type dependent topological rigidity parameters. Kelires  and his co-workers had indicated the shortcomings of the MD technique to  predict the properties of the group IV alloys and have pioneered the use  of MC which does not have limitations of MD.

Among the models based on such considerations  the model of Dalvi & Suresh (2011) has the correct asymptotic limits. In present study  single step reaction between intimately mixed solid powders of Ca12Al14O33 (C12A7) and CaO (C) in formation of Ca3Al2O4 (C3A) is studied as a candidate system. The two major purposes of this study are (i) To demonstrate the effect of number of contact points (between particles of C and those of C12A7) and hence examine the validity of the contact point models (ii) To evolve a methodology consistent with the contact point models for estimating the kinetic parameters from literature. The scope of work involves (i) Synthesis of C12A7 and C with desired sizes to design experiments with different NAB; (ii) establishment of a protocol based on quantitative XRD for analysis of reaction samples (iii) Performing reactions on intimately mixed and pelletized specimens with wide range of NAB (3 to 3487) and at different temperatures; (iv) establishment of a parameter estimation methodology to interpret the kinetic data and determination of the kinetic parameters. It is shown in this study that  NAB significantly affects the kinetics and estimated kinetic parameters  diffusion co-efficient (D)  activations energy (Q)  and Initial neck size ratio between reacting particles (x1) in C12A7-C system by interpretation of data with diffusion controlled models from literature (Dalvi & Suresh  2011; Ginstling & Brounshtein  1950).

Nearly 70% of the biologics are  produced using Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells as the hosts. Investing  quite a huge amount of money and time in creating a ""producer cell  line""  biopharmaceutical industries focus on enhancing productivity to  gain higher profits. To enhance productivity  it is essential to  understand productivity at the molecular level. Productivity is a  multifaceted phenomenon involving different metabolic pathways inside  the cell. Engineering growth  apoptosis and energy metabolism leads to  an increase in total cell numbers and high product titres. In contrast   engineering protein secretion increases the protein production per cell  by enhancing the protein processing efficiency of the cell. Different  cell engineering approaches had been tried in the past to increase the  productivity using this pathway. Though promising  the results from  these studies are conflicting and are often cell line and protein  dependent.  The objective of this project is to understand the relationship between  productivity and protein processing inside the Endoplasmic Reticulum  (ER) using a systems approach. Two recombinant CHO cell lines secreting  anti-rhesus D IgG with a 10-fold difference in their productivities were  compared at their growth and recombinant mRNA levels. Specific protein  processing pathway genes of ER were also compared at their mRNA levels  between these cell lines. IgG heavy chain mRNA was limiting productivity  with dynamic expression of chaperones and UPR genes. Interestingly  mRNA  levels of IgG HC and key UPR genes showed a higher correlation with  productivities. Further  the expression of recombinant mRNA and UPR  activity were perturbed using chemical modulators. Perturbing  recombinant mRNA expression lead to an increase in productivity with  transient induction of major ER stress response genes. Artificial  induction of ER stress did not increase productivity suggesting that  both recombinant mRNA expression and higher UPR activity are essential  to increase productivity in recombinant CHO cells. With the availability  of huge amount of growth  kinetic  productivity and mRNA levels of  different UPR genes in different cell lines  a multivariate regression  analysis was done to identify key factors influencing productivity.  These factors may be of vital importance in the process of creating a  ""super producer"".

The reactivity enhancement is not  only based on the location of particles in the porous solid but also on  the structural features of the latter. With this objective  I will  discuss about photocatalytic degradation of dye by semiconductor  nanoparticle (SnO2  TiO2  and SnxTi1-xO2) - mesoporous silica (SBA-15)  hybrid in the first part of the talk  where nanoparticles are embedded  inside the hydrophilic SBA-15 without pore blockage. We find that  obtained first order rate constant (K = 0.031 min-1) by  Sn0.05Ti0.95O2-SBA-15 is more than ten times and five times of only SnO2  and only TiO2 nanoparticles  respectively. Next  I will discuss about  SnO2-CMK-5 in the second part of talk  where SnO2 nanoparticles are  embedded in-between the mesopores of the hydrophobic CMK-5 and tested  for its reactivity against lithium-ion in lithium-ion battery. The  diffusion coefficient of the Li+ ion inside SnO2-CMK-5 (1.1 × 10-13 cm2  s-1) is two orders of magnitude larger than that of only bare SnO2  electrodes (8.5 × 10-15 cm2 s-1). As a result  the specific capacity by  SnO2-CMK-5 is 598 mA h g-1 at a current density of 178 mA g-1 after 30  cycles  which is much higher than that of only SnO2 (42 mA h g-1) or  only CMK-5 (218 mA h g-1) electrodes. Finally  to show the benefit of  particle location on the external surface of a porous solid  a strategy  to selectively attach more Ag nanoparticles on the external surface of  activated carbon was developed to increase the death rate of E.coli.  This shows an order of magnitude increase in death rate constant from  3.72 to 41.88 h−1. These three studies thus show the importance of  selective embedding of nanoparticles on a mesoporous solid to enhance  their reactivity by considering the advantage of different templating  and surface functionalization strategies  for optimum benefit  as per  the needs of the application  whether  photocatalysis  energy storage  device or water treatment.

In the present work  glucose oxidase (GOD) enzyme was  immobilized in mesoporous silica (SBA-15) host particles. The effect of  external morphology  aspect ratio  internal pore diameter of SBA-15  particles and surface functionalization of SBA-15 on GOD activity and  performance of the glucose biosensor was studied. Activity and glucose  sensing experiments suggest that  amine functionalized SBA-15 host  particles (cuboid morphology) with smaller aspect ratio (1.1) and larger  mesopore diameter (11.4 nm)  together with appropriate enzyme loading  density (0.043 μg GOD/cm2 area of electrode) and ferrocene (an electron  mediator  40 μM)  ensures good sensor performance. This led to a large  linear range of glucose (0.4-13.0 mM)  better sensitivity (0.65  µAcm-2mM-1) and a short response time (< 5 s). As the glucose sensing in  this work was based on enzymatically generated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)   hence  a highly selective and sensitive H2O2 chemical sensor was  developed by impregnating silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in amine  functionalized cuboid SBA-15 host particles. The sensor showed a wide  linearity range (5.3-124.5 mM H2O2) and a high sensitivity of 171.3 μA  cm−2 mM−1  due to a high loading (17.2 wt.%) of electrically conductive  AgNPs achieved in host particles. Therefore  the present work  demonstrate that a careful selection of both structural (particle  morphologies  aspect ratio  internal pore diameter  surface  functionalization) and compositional (enzyme loading  electron mediator   AgNP loading) variables leads to improved performances of both biosensor  and chemical sensor  in terms of desirable sensor-characteristics  like  linearity  sensitivity  selectivity and speed of response.

Thermodynamics and rheology of self assembled mesophases of nanoparticles:    Anisotropic interaction fields encoded in nanoparticles of non-spherical shape can drive their assembly into many complex  ordered or partially ordered structures (”mesophases”). Some of these self-assembled ’phases’ are highly desirable for their distinctive electronic  mechanical and optical properties and are very sensitive to the inherent interactions of their building blocks and other external driving fields. To understand the basic principles controlling formation of these assemblies  we performed systematic simulation studies to explore the effect of ’shape’ or excluded volume interactions on the equilibrium mesophase behavior and on selected non-equilibrium mechanical properties of these systems. Together  these findings makes a stride towards general understanding and classification of the effect of particle shape on thermophysical properties of its assemblies.  Rheology of industrial polymeric resins:      An integrated kinetic Monte Carlo  tube theory approach is constructed to generate molecular ensembles of polymeric resins with their topological details based on the reactor process conditions and catalyst chemistry. These detailed ensembles are hence used to generate relevant information for tube theory calculations which result in rheology predictions for industrial polymeric resins.

Transformation of selected cyanobacteria  resulting in targeted gene replacement  deletion or addition is  relatively facile  and consequently metabolic steps or even pathways can  be introduced or enhanced in the cyanobacterium.  The organism that is  the focus of our research is Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803  which is a  well-studied model organism that can use a variety of carbon sources  (and thereby employ several different growth modes) and that is amenable  to outdoor cultivation in enclosed photobioreactors.  Examples of  metabolic modifications that we have analyzed in our group are  introduction of genes enabling production of isoprene and free fatty  acids.  Efficiencies and rate limitations will be discussed. In the case  of fatty acid production  the amount of energy stored in the fatty acid  can be up to 28% of the energy of the light if one were to excite with  680 nm light and all absorbed light was used for fatty acid production.  Making adjustments for solar illumination (only ~50% of the energy can  be used for photosynthesis)  blue-photon utilization  and losses due to  non-photochemical quenching and the requirements for maintenance energy   the solar energy conversion efficiency may still be in the range of  ~7%  which is superior to most other bio-based approaches.

His research work over the years has  focused on cyanobacteria  particularly on photosynthesis and molecular  physiology in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.  Early work involved tool  development and molecular-genetic approaches to determine the function  of individual subunits and protein complexes in photosynthetic electron  transport  and as this work matured  he included more applied work on  cyanobacteria as solar-powered biocatalysts to produce useful compounds  in the scientific repertoire.

The irregular-shaped cavity consists of  three distinct zones: a spalled-rubble zone on the cavity floor  a  cavity roof at the top and a void zone between the two. During UCG  the  coal seam between the injection and production wells undergoes two  distinct growth phases. In phase-I  coal/char near injection well gets  consumed and cavity grows in a vertical (radial) direction and hits the  overburden. Phase-II starts thereafter  in which the cavity grows in the  horizontal direction towards the production well. In this work   unsteady-state models for gas production during both phase-I and  phase-II are developed. Model requires reaction inputs such as kinetics   spalling characteristics  heat and mass transfer effects and flow  patterns. To establish non-ideal flow patterns in the cavity  a  computationally less expensive compartment modeling approach  based on  computational flow dynamics (CFD)  is used. Furthermore  heterogeneous  reaction kinetic parameters are experimentally determined; whereas  parameters for heat and mass transfer and thermo-mechanical failure  (spalling) of coal of interest are used for model development. In the  process of kinetics modeling  a novel reactor has been designed   constructed and used for determination of faster reaction kinetics e.g.  char combustion. The simulations are performed for a typical Indian  lignite and the results are interpreted to demonstrate potential of the  developed model. The simulation results are also compared with the  results of the reported laboratory-scale experiments performed on the  same coal under UCG-like conditions. As a logical extension of model  development and validation  this research involved study on finding  optimum set of operating conditions and effects of coal properties on  key performance indicators such as exit gas composition  calorific value.

Some examples are iron-molybdate for methanol  oxidation to formaldehyde and bismuth-molybdate for propylene  ammoxidation to acrylonitrile. However  the reason behind their activity  and selectivity is still not well-understood. To address these  fundamental questions  spectroscopic and kinetic studies were undertaken  to provide quantitative bulk and surface information. Raman  IR and  CH3OH-temperature programmed surface reaction (TPSR)  low energy ion  scattering (LEISS) spectroscopy along with steady state methanol  oxidation were employed to investigate the fundamentals responsible for  the activity of bulk mixed molybdate catalyst. To examine the literature hypothesis that M=O bonds are responsible for  the activity of bulk mixed metal oxides  a series of bulk mixed  vanadates and molybdates were synthesized. Their methanol oxidation  activity was compared with the corresponding M=O Raman vibrations and  crystallographic bond lengths. No particular relationship  however  was  found between the bulk M=O bond length and its catalytic activity (TOF).  Low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEISS) has been employed to  probe the surface of bulk mixed vanadium and molybdenum oxides. The  results reveal the enrichment of the surface with vanadium and  molybdenum oxide species  which is responsible for the activity and  selectivity of mixed oxides towards formaldehyde product. The result encouraged towards investigating bulk iron-molybdate  (Fe2(MoO4)3) catalyst for their catalytic activity towards the methanol  oxidation reaction. The stoichiometric iron-molybdate (Mo/Fe=1.5) has  mostly exposed molybdate species along with a small amount of exposed  FeOx sites on the surface. With increasing Mo/Fe ratio (> 1.5)  the  excess MoO3 covers the exposed FeOx sites and increases the selectivity  towards the desired HCHO product from surface MoOx sites and reduces the  selectivity of undesired dimethyl ether from surface FeOx sites. Similar  information was also obtained from the CH3OH-IR spectroscopy  measurements. The bulk Fe2(MoO4)3 catalyst follow the Mars-van Krevelen  reaction mechanism employing bulk lattice oxygen. These studies  demonstrate that the bulk mixed metal molybdate catalysts are surface  enriched with surface molybdena species  which are the catalytic active  sites for redox selective oxidation reactions. It is noteworthy that  similar results have also been observed with bulk mixed metal vanadates.

Generally the raw materials are heterogeneous  and their physical and chemical characteristics vary from one source to  another. Industrial case study on induration of wet iron ore pellets in  a moving packed bed reactor will be presented in this talk. Pelletization of iron ores involves two processing steps  balling of  fine particles on a rotating disc into wet pellets  which are then  converted into fired pellets on a moving straight grate induration  furnace. The quality of fired pellets has a strong influence on the  productivity of the reduction furnace and on the quality of hot metal.  Hence  maintaining pellet quality within the desirable specifications is  critical while optimizing the induration process to enhance furnace  productivity and energy efficiency. On the other hand  because of  dwindling natural iron ore resources  plant operations team has to deal  with iron ore from multiple sources with widely different  characteristics. There is a need for dynamic optimization of processing  conditions to produce pellets of desirable quality. Moreover  pellet  quality is analyzed off-line through laboratory analyses. It is also  difficult to measure any intrinsic process parameters such as pellet bed  permeability  time-temperature history of pellets and chemical  composition of gases. We have developed a model-based optimization system (Virtual  InduratorTM) that incorporates an induration process model based on  first principles. Secondly  since pellet quality measurements are not  available on-line  we have developed a model to predict pellet quality  parameters  based on mining and analysis of the actual measurements and  laboratory analyses and simulated data for variables that are not  measured. Thirdly  in order to optimize the process to enhance  productivity while meeting product quality specifications  we have  developed optimization and control algorithms. The on-line induration  process data are obtained through the DCS while the raw material  characteristics and product quality data are obtained through LIMS.  These data are stored in a real-time database and the model predicts  pellet temperature-time history  moisture profile  coke consumption  profile  etc.  during induration. Secondly  using the built-in pellet  quality sensor  the system predics Cold Compression Strength (CCS) and  Tumble Index (TI). This information is then used by the optimization  algorithm to determine whether the plant is currently running optimally  or not. Based on the results of optimization  the operator is provided  with a set of operating conditions which could lead to enhanced  productivity while meeting product quality specifications. This system  was implemented at pellet plants in India and abroad and helped in  enhancing productivity and in reducing fuel consumption.

The exact mechanism by which cells sense the rigidity of the substrate  is not understood. To better understand the mechanism involved  we  varied the center-to-center spacing of the 500 nm micropillars from 1 to  3 micrometers and compared two different cell lines.  We observed that  the displacements of the pillars were constant over an order of  magnitude variation in stiffness of pillars and a five-fold variation in  edge-to-edge spacing between pillars. Mouse embryonic fibroblast  (RPTPα+/+) and human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells produced consistent  maximal pillar displacements of ~60 nm (with a minor peak at ~120nm  observed in the mouse cells). In all cases  displacements were due to  localized contractions in ~2-3 micrometer regions at the cell edge.  Perturbation of the actomyosin machinery by the myosin inhibitor  blebbistatin or over-expression of myosin ATPase inhibitory protein   caldesmon  caused a decrease in the frequency of the pulling events  without changing the average displacements. Inhibition of Src family  kinases using PP2 caused the cells to have a wider range of  displacements than was observed in untreated cells. Our results indicate  that the contractile machinery is powered by a localized (up to 3  micrometers)  actomyosin cassette. Delineating the components of the  localized contraction units is crucial to understand the sensing of the  substrate stiffness by cells and has implications for cell  differentiation and metastasis. 2) In the body  soft tissues often undergo cycles of stretch and  relaxation but it is not known if those affect cell behavior.  We find  that soft pillar arrays will not support cell spreading and growth.  Since the rigidity of the pillars will not change dramatically when the  substrate is stretched  we asked if the application of force by  stretching a matrix of nearly constant rigidity would affect behavior.  Surprisingly  we found that although 5% static stretch of the pillars  did not alter cell spreading or growth  5% cyclic stretch over a  frequency range of 0.01 to 10 Hz caused significant increases in  spreading and stress fiber formation with the optimum at 0.1 Hz.  Similarly  there was an increase in the rate of cell growth as measured  by BrdU incorporation into DNA over this frequency range.  At 0.01 Hz   we found that cyclic stretching for 10 s (relaxation for 90s) did not  cause significant spreading whereas cyclic stretching for 50 or 90 s (50  and 10 s of relaxation) did.  We conclude that the application of force  to cells by a soft matrix can substitute for a stiff matrix in  stimulating (this can explain why some cells may be stimulated to grow  upon physical activity—i.e. use it or lose it).

In contrast to proliferating cells  where the dynamic drama of DNA replication and chromosome segregation play out  or differentiated cells  which permanently eschew proliferation in favour of tissue-specific functions; these dormant or quiescent cells execute a balancing act which permits them to retain their potency for tissue repair yet not elaborate those functions until called upon by injury. The quiescence program benefits the organism in that a reserve stem cell pool is available for future unpredictable bouts of repair  but the mechanisms by which quiescent cells prevent the expression of tissue-specific genes are not well defined. Quiescent cells must deploy memory mechanisms if they are to fulfil their regenerative role; when activated  these previously dormant cells must remember their identity as cell type-specific progenitors. Mechano-chemical signalling pathways appear to be linked with those that control the cell cycle and tissue-specific genes. This talk will discuss the concept of active regulation by a multiplicity of mechanisms induced in quiescence to promote stem cell function.

Extremely water repelling surfaces in air called as superhydrophobic surfaces are one of the most recognized and well-studied anti-wetting material in literature. Intense efforts have been directed toward the design of synthetic mimics of these materials for the design of self-cleaning surfaces  coatings that prevent corrosion or fogging  and advanced materials for water harvesting  oil-water separation  and a host of other emerging applications. A common approach to the design of synthetic superhydrophobic surfaces is one inspired by the natural structure of the lotus leaf  and generally involves the fabrication of surfaces with (i) appropriate combinations of microscale and nanoscale topography topped by (ii) a thin  low surface energy coating. While this approach is both useful and widely practiced  the practical utility of materials having this design is reduced in scenarios that expose them to physical insults (e.g.  scratches) that can compromise low-energy coatings or physically degrade  remove  or destroy micro- and nanoscale surfaces features required to repel water and maintain non-wetting behavior. The pursuit of superhydrophobic surfaces that are physically robust and mechanically durable is a vibrant area of research and is important in both fundamental and applied contexts. Here  in my talk I will talk about how to design a robust and self-healing superhydrophobic coating based on three dimensional porous polymer coating and their several prospective applications such as drug delivery  guided water transfer etc.  In second part of my presentation  I will talk about thermotropic liquid crystal droplets in context of sensing amphiphilic molecules. Liquid crystal droplet has immense prospect in sensing application-but at the same time  they are extremely sensitive  and they lose their property even after interacting with bare glass surface.

Abstract: Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is a novel combustion technology that offers a highly efficient route towards clean combustion of fuel with inherent CO2 capture. In CLC  a fuel is combusted in reducer reactor in contact with an oxygen carrier (typically a metal oxide) and subsequently re-oxidized by air in oxidizer. Condensation of steam from reducer effluent results in high purity sequestration ready CO2 streams. Thus CLC results in a NOx-lean  flame-less oxyfuel combustion process eliminating the need for air separation. Splitting the combustion into two half processes provides a high degree of flexibility in CLC for process intensification  e.g. a wide range of oxygen carriers  fuels and oxidant gases can be used  albeit use of various fuels/oxidants have their own challenges. Typically in CLC  a metal is supported on a high temperature stable matrix to provide the required thermal stability in harsh redox conditions. However these non-reducible supports do not contribute any oxygen in the combustion process or facilitate the reduction of supported metal. Therefore in the present work  we test the applicability of reducible oxides like ceria as supports in CLC. It was found that  compared to non-reducible supports  the redox properties of ceria strongly facilitate efficient utilization of metal oxides in the process  thus resulting in improved redox kinetics and higher carrier conversion. The broad applicability of the concept was tested with various transition metals typically used in CLC. Furthermore  the reactivity of carriers was enhanced by employing systematically engineered mixed-oxides of iron  nickel and/or manganese. Beyond combustion  tailoring the metal phase and reactor operation was used for partial oxidation of methane to produce syngas – a valuable feedstock in chemical industry. Utilization of the looping concept for partial oxidation results in a safe oxidation process eliminating the need for expensive air separation or noble metal catalysts. Steam  CO2 or mixtures of both can be used as oxidants for ultra-pure H2 or syngas generation and CO2 activation. Current work underscores the fact that reactor operation in chemical looping allows targeting clean combustion  partial oxidation or various reforming processes  but rational design of oxygen carriers makes these processes viable.

For example  the semiconductor devices and solar cell industry requires high quality crystalline silicon (si) wafers  laser and radiation detector technologies use high quality fiber crystals and nanocrystals find use in many novel applications. However  in order to grow high quality crystals  it is crucial to have a good understanding of the crystal growth processes. This talk concerns with how such an understanding can be developed with the aid of numerical simulations for systems where crystal is pulled from a melt pool. I will describe two processes  first  micro-pulling-down (μ-PD) in the lab scale and second Czochralski (Cz) in the industry scale. μ-PD process has become a method of choice to grow fiber crystals in laboratories. It is also an economically viable option when crystals of new materials are to be grown during a material discovery research. However  in the absence of theoretical knowledge of proper growth conditions in the molten zone of the process  time-consuming trial and error procedure is often employed. Here  I discuss a quasi-steady-state (QSS) as well as time-dependent analysis using a two-dimensional axisymmetric finite element description of the molten zone of the process. QSS results show different ways in which the operation can be limited or a failure can occur. It also clearly shows the inadequacy of an old one-dimensional model  developed for capillary-dominated systems  in prescribing stability criteria. Time-dependent simulations are utilized to do a non-linear stability analysis of the QSS states. Conceptually  the general framework utilized to conduct this investigation can be extended to other crystal-pulling-from-melt processes. Cz process is widely used in industry to make semiconductor and solar grade silicon wafers. Engineering of desired defect characteristics in the crystal is crucial for semiconductor device or solar cell fabrication. In a segment of a growing Cz crystal  microdefects nucleate at different times and temperatures and grow to different sizes. Therefore  a rigorous model requires very large computational expenditure to keep track of formation and path histories of various aggregates or clusters  rendering it impractical for predictions. I describe a computationally efficient model based on a lumped approach to quantify the distribution of microdefect population at any given location in Cz grown silicon crystals and validated against that of a rigorous model.

Date: Monday  14th December  11 a.m. -12 noon.   Abstract: Like most organisms  Escherichia coli readily metabolizes glucose as a carbon and energy source.  Preventing E. coli from metabolizing glucose allows this model organism to accomplish several interesting conversions. Preventing glucose metabolism allows E. coli to grow readily on other sugars or on inhibitors such as acetate in the presence of glucose.  This concept is central to designing microbial consortia for the convers ion of lignocellulosic hydrolysates. For example  a single process can simultaneously utilize glucose and xylose by using two “substrate-selective” strains  one unable to consume glucose and one unable to consume xylose.  Inhibitors can be removed from sugar mixtures in an analogous fashion: to remove acetate selectively from an acetate/xylose/glucose mixture would require a single strain unable to metabolize either xylose or glucose.  These results are discussed in the context of lactate and succinate production  and the conversion of variable sugar feed streams. Preventing glucose metabolism also allows glucose to accumulate as a final product derived from other carbon sources.

Venue: Room 240  Chemical Engineering. Date: Monday  14th December  3-4 p.m. Abstract: Clathrate hydrate science has evolved over the centuries from a mere academic curiosity to being a nuisance to oil and gas industry (flow assurance) and now is being seen as a future energy resource (natural gas hydrates deposits). The clathrate hydrate process has also been demonstrated over the years as promising for innovative applications like natural gas storage  carbon capture  seawater desalination  cold storage etc. Some challenges remain specific to each of these focus areas that needs to be overcome inorder to commercialize these applications. In this presentation  the state of the art on gas hydrate technology for three applications pertaining to carbon capture  seawater desalination and natural gas storage will be discussed in detail. The focus will be on pre-combustion carbon capture from IGCC power plants. Hydrate based gas separation (HBGS) process is the most environmental friendly approach as water is used as a solvent to capture CO2 via forming clathrate hydrates. Compared to conventional technologies  high CO2 capacity and CO2 regeneration under high pressure are key characteristic advantages for the HBGS process for CO2 capture. Another application that has received renewed interest is seawater desalination using the hydrate based desalination (HBD) process. Our recent knowledge on enhancing the kinetics can be applied to efficiently desalinate seawater to produce potable water. An innovative approach to offset the refrigeration cost for the HBD process will be discussed. Finally  our recent findings on solidified natural gas (SNG) technology for large-scale natural gas storage will be highlighted.

In many of these applications gels are subjected to large-strain deformation  however    very little is known how swollen gels with different structure behave at large-strain. In this presentation  I will present our recent results on the non-linear mechanical response at large-strain  elastic instability  and failure behavior of two different gels: a physically crosslinked gel (triblock gel) and an ionically crosslinked gel (alginate). The physical gel is obtained by dissolving a triblock copolymer poly methylmethacrylate-poly n-butylacrylate-poly methylmethacrylate (PMMA-PnBA-PMMA) in a mid-block selective solvent  2-ethyl 1-hexanol. Alginate gels are obtained by crosslinking alginates using calcium salts. We use both cavitation and shear rheology to investigate the deformation behavior of polymer gels. Cavitation rheology is a new characterization technique for the measurement of mechanical properties of soft materials on small length scales  e.g. 10 -1000 μm  at any arbitrary location within a gel. The technique involves growing a cavity at the tip of a syringe needle and monitoring the pressure of the cavity at the onset of instability. This critical pressure  Pc  is directly related to the local elastic modulus of the material.  The mechanical properties of these gels were also studied using large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) experiments. Both cavitation and LAOS results capture distinctly different non-linear behavior and failure responses of triblock and alginate gels.  The effect of graphene nanoplatelets on the self-assembly and mechanical properties of the triblock gel will also be presented. Our results provide a fundamental understanding gel failure mechanism at large-strain. Bio: Dr. Santanu Kundu is an Assistant Professor in the Dave C.

These systems in general and multiphase reactors in particular are complex  as they can take various configurations and types based on the way the phases are contacted and interact. Their design  scale-up  proper operation and performance prediction are challenging tasks due to the lack of understanding of these complex interactions. In addition the complexity increases with the presence of internals that affect the hydrodynamics  mixing  transport (mass and heat) and reactions and hence  the performance of these reactors. Sophisticated techniques that integrate measurements of various hydrodynamic and transport parameters are required. Such instrumentation provide effective diagnostic means for indentifying and quantifying flow related issues in these systems  as well as fundamental insights into these systems. Some of these instrumentation and measurement techniques are employed in our laboratory to study various complex reactors and flow systems such as: I) techniques that are  based on radioisotopes – radioactive particle tracking (RPT)  dual source gamma ray tomography (DSCT)  gamma ray densitometry (GRD) for 3D flow field  velocity and turbulence parameters  phase distribution and flow pattern identification; and II) techniques that are not based on radioisotopes: four-point optical probe for bubble dynamics  heat transfer probe  combination of bubble dynamics and heat transfer probe  optical probes for solids dynamics that measure simultaneously solids velocity and holdups and their fluctuations  integration of hot wire anemometry and heat transfer probe  gas tracer dynamics  optical probe for local mass transfer  gas tracer technique for global mass transfer  optical probe for liquid velocity distribution in packed beds  pressure transducers  and others. These techniques are augmented with sophisticated mathematical algorithms and programs that have been developed in our laboratory for data acquisition  processing and image reconstruction. The utilization of these techniques is complemented by modeling and scale-up methodologies and CFD computations. In particular  this is of great relevance to the refining industry since no other sector of human activity involves such a multitude of multiphase processes.

Abstract : Colorectal carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies worldwide and there is an unmet medical need in order to treat patients with surgically incurable disease. The underlying biology of CRC is complex and heterogeneous making it one of the most interesting malignancies for exploring treatment options at this time. Hence  in this study the efficacy of various CDK inhibitors with differing CDK inhibitory spectrum  on colon cancer cell lines with different genetic status was determined. Moreover  the molecular pharmacology of diverse CDK inhibitors was studied in human colon cancer cells in order to analyze their effect on complex deregulated signalling pathways. Further  the effect on combination with current therapy for colorectal cancer was studied in order to determine their impending clinical utility. The central findings of the study are that all three CDK inhibitors with varied selectivity and potency inhibited proliferation of CRC cells and induced apoptosis. UCN-01 being a pan-CDK non-specific inhibitor was the most potent followed by P276-00  a relatively specific CDK inhibitor with higher CDK inhibitory potential than roscovitine which was the least potent. Mechanisms of cell cycle regulation are frequently altered in colorectal cancer. Replacement of at least some of the missing capacity to inhibit cell cycle progression by small molecule CDK inhibitors could be attributed to their anticancer potential against CRC cell lines. Besides  CDK inhibitors also exhibited variable and cell line dependent effects on complex deregulated signalling pathways. In addition  all three CDK inhibitors exhibited synergism in combination with current chemotherapeutic drugs used for the treatment of CRC although the response varied among the cell lines used. Thus  these studies could serve as a groundwork for more focused potential clinical trials and consequently  for tailoring therapies to improve treatment for specific tumor types in human colorectal carcinoma.","webmaster","5 Jan 2015 - 07:53","5 Jan 2015 - 07:56","Seminar/Talk","Ms. Sonal Manohar  Junior Research Scientist  Piramal Life Sciences","Understanding the molecular pharmacology of diverse CDK inhibitors in human colorectal carcinoma","Room 240  Computer Lab  Chemical Engineering","5 Jan 2015 - 16:00","5 Jan 2015 - 17:00","185"

Abstract : Most models in polymer solution rheology assume that the steady state stress is uniquely determined by the rate of deformation. Yet in 1974  de Gennes suggested that the time history of deformation has a crucial bearing on the steady state value of stress. Since the hydrodynamic drag force experienced by a polymer molecule depends on its conformation  de Gennes conjectured that in extension dominated flows  depending on the deformation history  it is possible for a dilute polymer solution to manifest multiple values of stress at a single strain rate  and consequently exhibit hysteretic behaviour. The importance of de Gennes contention has paradigm changing implications for the modelling of polymer rheology since the accurate estimation of the relationship between stress and strain in a solution lies at the heart of being able to develop a realistic description of the flow of polymer solutions. It took 30 years before experimental evidence could be obtained in support of this argument. Individual DNA molecules in ultra-dilute solutions subjected to planar elongational flow were shown to be either coiled or highly stretched depending on the history of deformation. Since the stress in a polymer solution has its origin predominantly in the entropic resistance of individual polymer molecules to deformation from their equilibrium coiled state  the experiments indirectly validate de Gennes hypothesis of different deformation histories leading to disparate states of stress. Subsequent Brownian dynamics simulations of dilute polymer solutions have confirmed the existence of hysteresis  both in polymer chain conformations  and in the steady state stress. Recent scaling arguments and experiments carried out at Monash University suggest that the concentration of polymers has a significant non-monotonic influence on the extent of coil-stretch hysteresis  with a initial growth in hysteresis followed by extinction  as the polymer concentration increases. Additionally  it has been known since de Gennes early theory  that increasing the fraction of shear in a mixed flow of planar shear and extension dramatically decreases the magnitude of coil-stretch hysteresis. In this talk  I will discuss the development of a mesoscopic Brownian dynamics simulation algorithm that is capable of accurately describing polymer solutions undergoing planar mixed flows at finite polymer concentrations. The simulations permit the examination of the competing roles of polymer concentration and flow mixedness on the extent of coil-stretch hysteresis  and provide a fascinating insight into the influence of non-linear phenomena on the molecular scale on macroscopic solution properties.

Identification of Irreducible Infeasible Sets (IIS) in a model can help speed up the process of correcting infeasible models. Identifying an IIS provides the modeller with a set of inconsistencies that need to be corrected. While several algorithms have been proposed  efficient implementations are only available for IIS isolation in linear programs(LPs). We propose a novel algorithm for IIS identification that is applicable to NLPs and MINLPs. The proposed algorithm makes use of feasibility-based reduction techniques in a computationally inexpensive preprocessing stage to test for infeasibility for subparts of the infeasible model. This stage allows for rapid elimination of a large number of constraints in the model providing a significant speedup in IIS identification. We implement our proposed algorithm within the global solver BARON. The utility of this algorithm is demonstrated through computational experiments on a test set of 805 infeasible problems. Computational results demonstrate that the algorithm is effective on allproblem classes. The preprocessing step is able to speed  up IIS identification by 4 times on average  and by as high as 100 times for some problems. For 65% of the test problems  the preprocessing step is able to eliminate all constraints not part of an IIS. In a complementary research direction  in order to strengthen relaxations for global optimization  we propose explicit use of first order optimality conditions in problem formulation. For problems with edge concave intermediates  we also investigate cutting plane generation techniques.

Examples include mixtures of microtubules and molecular motors (the machinery that acts as a cellular engine or cells themselves)  bacteria  vibrating granular rods  flocks of birds and schools of fish. We model such active systems using continuum theory of an active nematic to show that active turbulence develops in two stages: (i) ordered regions undergo an intrinsic hydrodynamic instability generating lines of strong deformations  (ii) the lines relax by forming oppositely charged pairs of topological defects. Defects and distortions in the director field act as sources of vorticity  and thus vorticity is strongly correlated to the director field. Topological defects can be continuously created and destroyed in biological systems and it seems that this dynamics underlies the turbulent patterns in active materials.

Be it photosynthesis (conversion of light into chemical energy)  or enzyme catalysis (speeding up difficult chemical reactions)  or ion channels (filtration device with high degree of specificity)  or self-assembly of small molecules into organized structures  we have a lot to learn from biology! The need for a molecular level understanding of nature has been dramatically asserted by Richard Feynman: Everything that living things do can be understood in terms of the jiggling and wiggling of atoms. Following this ambitious approach  my goal is to understand the complex biomolecular functions and properties from a molecular point of view. Using statistical mechanics based computational techniques  we are able to connect the molecular interactions (energetics) to their structural  thermodynamic and kinetic properties. The ultimate challenge is to obtain the underlying free energy surfaces for any (bio)chemical processes with quantitative accuracy and computational efficiency. In this talk  I shall take up two extreme examples: where nature does things fascinatingly well  and where it may go terribly wrong! The first part of my talk will deal with proton transport processes in a trans-membrane enzyme Cytochrome c Oxidase (CcO)  which reduces oxygen (O2) to water in our respiratory cycle and uses the released energy to pump protons across the membrane.

Communities of microorganisms can be injected below ground to feed on coal in a mine and convert it to methane gas. It is potentially a game-changing technology with immense commercial benefits. Energy in coal is usually extracted by burning it in capital-intensive power plants that throw toxic particulates and heavy metals into the atmosphere. Coal is justifiably considered to be a dirty fuel source. The US DOE estimates that about 90% of the global fossil fuel reserves consist of stranded coal that is at depths that cannot be mined by human miners  “Microbial miners” can survive at much greater depths. Toxic byproducts remain trapped in the coal seams instead of being released into the atmosphere. Using microbes as miners can effectively change coal from a dirty to a clean fuel source. The microbial community is at the heart of the biotransformation of coal to methane gas. The interface of energy  biotechnology and mining provides a rich source of research challenges. The goal of our research is to characterize and model the microbial communities and the fluid flow below ground in order to ensure high yields  reaction rates and selectivity.  Three distinct models have been developed using mathematical and “agent-based” artificial intelligence approaches. Both biochemical reaction engineering and fluid flow considerations are important for these models. Such models can be used for the understanding of metabolic bottlenecks  to design nutritional interventions  and to monitor and control the overall process.

Venue : Lecture Hall No. 22  2^nd floor  VMCC  IIT Bombay *Abstract:* Nature is unparalleled in its structural and functional diversity. Living organisms make fantastic materials under myriad conditions with properties we cannot emulate today using conventional approaches. In many cases  nature has provided us with a blueprint to design and assemble both natural and synthetic building blocks to create a new generation of functional  organized  and responsive materials. We have taken cues from nature to design materials with unique structural and functional properties  along with new process technologies with the ability to produce a wide range of biomimetic structures. Specifically  we have focused on the generation of nanostructures that are functionalized with and in some cases constructed from biological molecules  complete with tailored selectivities and biocatalytic activities. For example  these nanostructures have been exploited in the generation of biocatalytically functional polymeric films  coatings  and paints that kill bacteria  prevent biofilm formation  and reduce fouling by bioorganic molecules. The speakerwill highlight our recent efforts to exploit the interface of biology with materials science  enhancing enzyme function along the way. Both fundamental advances and applications will be discussed  the latter focused on enzyme-nanomaterial composites with a wide range of activities that endow surfaces with decontaminating properties. In particular  surfaces have been generated with tailored activity against hospital-acquired infections (e.g.  MRSA)  food-borne illnesses (e.g.  Listeria)  and bacillus spores. Such activity provides a safe and potentially broadly applicable route to eliminating toxic compounds and pathogenic microorganisms from common surfaces.  *About the Speaker:* Dr. Jonathan S.

The CAMD approach employs structure property correlations and  generally  an optimization technique to find a potential solvent for a physical separation process. The proposed computational scheme has been applied to design a solvent for the extraction of R-phenylacetylcarbinol (R-PAC)  a pharmaceutical intermediate in the manufacture of pseudoephedrine (which finds extensive use in cold and influenza medication) from an aqueousphase. The experimental vapour-liquid equilibria data of R-PAC reported in literature is limited to vapour pressures at three different temperatures  including the normal boiling point.  Hence  the thermodynamic properties of R-PAC are predicted using Marrero-Gani method combined with EoS approach  and also molecular simulations as the first step to optimize the process design for the production of R-PAC. Further  current industrial practice employs toluene as solvent for extraction of R-PAC and the objective of this research is to use the proposed computational scheme to design a solvent with extraction properties superior to that of toluene. In this computational scheme  we have introduced the use of molecular simulations to verify that the CAMD predicted solvent molecules have superior extraction properties. These results are  then  finally confirmed using experiments. The solvents designed belong to three different categories: aliphatic  and aromatic organic molecules  and ionic liquids.

Abstract: Many petrochemical compounds that are candidates for microbial production are also solvent-like in nature. Examples of such compounds are fuels and other bulk chemicals such as precursors for polymers and plastics. For these compounds  two aspects impede the efficiency of microbial production. One is their inherent solvent like nature that results in toxicity towards the microbe. Second is product inhibition due to intracellular accumulation. We have used both systems and synthetic biology to successfully investigate the role of cellular transporters and other tolerance genes  towards improving biofuel tolerance and production in Escherichia coli. Using simple but effective competition based strategies we identified heterologous pumps that bestowed tolerance against representative biogasoline  biodiesel and biojetfuel candidates. We find functional genomics to be a useful approach to prospect for tolerance bestowing transporters and other genes  and have used such candidates successfully to increase both tolerance and production levels. Transporters specifically stand out as an ideal tolerance mechanism  as they also serve to export a final product. Building upon the discovery of various transport systems  we are now exploring several avenues to optimize the use of transporters in microbial host engineering. Strategies that improve the efficiency of a transporter (e.g. via directed evolution) have allowed us to bypass the necessity to overexpress these high burden systems. Optimization of expression systems has also proven to be important in maximizing the fitness phenotypes in production strains.

Venue : LC 102 Abstract: Microwave (MW) rapid heating has received considerable attention as a new promising method for one-pot synthesis of metallic nanostructures in solutions. In this concept  advantageous application of this method has been demonstrated for the green preparation of Pd  Ru  Au-Pd and Ru-Pd nanoparticles. By combining several characterizations  such as UV–vis spectroscopy  TEM  XRD  and DLS  the product was proved to possess size in the order of nanoscale. Due to large surface area to volume ratio of nanoparticles  catalytic degradation of Congo red azo dye was studied using the synthesized particles. Most of the literature deals with photocatalysis but drawbacks such as low quantum yields and requirement of UV light hinder its widespread acceptance as a practical remediation technology. Thus  the catalytic activity of prepared mono and bimetallic nanoparticles in reduction of azo dye in dark conditions was explored. In addition to this  electrocatalytic oxidation reactions of fuel cells using synthesized nanoparticles and synthesis and characterization of raspberry type hybrids will also be discussed.

Dept. Asbtract: The mechanics of granular materials (sand  food grains  powders) has historically been studied in the limiting regimes of slow and rapid flow. In the former  the grains are densely packed and stress is transmitted by sustained grain contacts. In the latter regime  grains are in continuous fluctuational motion  and stress is generated from the impulse transmitted during the brief grain collisions. In recent years  it has become evident that there is a vast regime of “intermediate flow” that lies between the above extremes  wherein the micromechanics and statistics of grain interaction is not clearly understood. In this presentation  I will highlight some of the peculiarities of the kinematics and rheology of granular flows in the slow and intermediate regimes.  I will motivate the use of protocols of fluid rheometry for granular materials  and address the complexities that arise when doing so. I will discuss the existing continuum models for dense granular flows  and point out their deficiencies.  I will then discuss some recent experimental results from my group in granular rheometry  and show how particle dynamics computations has helped resolve a major puzzle.  I will then close with some thoughts on the improvements needed for effective continuum mechanical modelling of granular materials  and how particle dynamics computations may be used for critical evaluation and refinement of proposed models.","webmaster","15 Apr 2015 - 12:52","15 Apr 2015 - 12:55","Seminar/Talk","Prof. Prabhu R.

Abstract: A central area of research in the soft matter community is in organic/organic hybrid materials with nanoscale inorganic particles. These materials have been focused on due to their promise of having synergistic thermal  mechanical and optical properties relative to the pure materials.It is now accepted that the spatial distribution of the inorganic nanoparticles critically affect the properties of the resulting materials but a grand challenge is to control the spatial distribution of the inorganic  hydrophilic nanoparticles in the organic  hydrophobic polymer matrix. I focus on one particular approach to controlling nanoparticle spatial dispersion  the use of polymer-grafted nanoparticles. In the case where the NP and the grafted polymer chains energetically “dislike” each other  we have an architecture akin to a microphase separated block copolymer or a surfactant. Analogous to these “surfactants” these grafted nanoparticles also assemble into a range of morphologies  thus giving us the unprecedented ability to control the particle dispersion state. We first focus on the factors controlling this assembly and use this knowledge to consider the utility of these materials in creating membranes which have the potential to revolutionalize the separation of hydrocarbons and in carbon sequestration and also in the creation of biomimetic materials.

Time & Venue: 26th March  5-6 pm  Room No. 240   Chemical Engg Abstract: Acetaminophen (APAP)  which is a widely used over-the-counter drug and considered safe and effective as an analgesic and antipyretic drug  is associated with hepatotoxicity in overdoses. To study the effect of phytoextract for hepatoprotection  APAP-induced toxicity model was hence established in vitro using HepG2 cell line  which mimic parenchyma cells of human liver. Various concentrations of APAP were evaluated to establish the toxicity model. The assessment of hepatocyte dysfunction includes cytotoxicity assessment by MTT assay  various biochemical parameters namely AST  ALT  GGT and ALP as the indices of hepatic injury. Various antioxidant defence mechanisms operates within the hepatocytes as excessive generation of ROS play a central role in APAP toxicity that can be studied to evaluate the extent of injury and following reversal by the phytoextract. In the current study  the generation of ROS was detected directly by employing a sensitive and automated flow cytometric technique using an intracellular dye DCFDA. Further  the cell cycle analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of APAP on different phases of cell cycle and monitor the level of apoptosis occurring as a consequence of APAP toxicity. This work was also performed employing flow cytometer involving the use of propidium iodide (PI) as a fluorescent dye which enters the cell on permeabilization and intercalates within the strands of the nuclear DNA quantitatively. Besides  the necrosis caused due to APAP induced hepatocyte injury was visualized by fluorescence imaging using EB/AO staining. Brassica juncea Czern. and Coss.  also known as Indian mustard  is an economically important plant that has been well known in India for centuries for its medicinal and nutritive values. The rich phytochemical profile of B. juncea and related species indicate the presence of various phytoconstituents reported to show varied pharmacological properties along with antioxidant potential. The broad spectrum of beneficial effects of the seeds observed in the earlier studies on B. juncea studies warrants further exploration of B. juncea seeds as a potential source for obtaining pharmacologically standardized phytotherapeutics  that could be potentially useful. The present study is one such attempt to rationalize the existing knowledge within the framework of modern science principles  practices and the techniques. Subsequently  the elucidation of mechanism of action of the characterized extract in hepatoprotection at the cellular level was also studied.

Use of water as solvent reaction medium is helpful in the practice to green approach and sustainability.  Micellar catalysis is currently a rapidly expanding area of research.

Use of water as solvent  solubilisation of organic compounds in water  generation of huge interfacial area  local concentration effect  stabilization of charged intermediate/transition state  reagent compatibility  surface pH effect  etc are the key attractive features of micellar system.

Venue      : Main Auditorium  Victor Menezes Convention Centre Abstract: Collections of grains (such as sand  food grains  mineral ores) often exhibit fluid-like behaviour  despite the obvious differences between macroscopic grains and fluid molecules. But there are qualitative differences in the details of their kinematic and stress response. The lecture will highlight the broad features of granular flows  their importance to industrial processes  and very briefly outline the continuum-mechanical models that describe them. Prof. Prabhu R. Nott will describe recent experiments that reveal the kinematics and stress in sheared granular materials  and compare it with that of fluids. The rheological properties of fluids are measured in devices that generate a class of simple flows  called viscometric flows — the cylindrical Couette cell  consisting of two coaxial cylinders is such a device. When a fluid is sheared by rotating the inner cylinder  the streamlines are circular for low angular speeds; above a critical speed  a centrifugal instability causes a secondary flow in the form of a vertical train of counter-rotating Taylor vortices. In contrast  experiments on dense granular materials show a large  single vortex that spans the entire column. The sense of the vortex is opposite to that of the Taylor vortex  and is present at very small angular speeds  suggesting that it is not the result of an instability  but an inherent feature of the flow. These observations are not explained by the existing continuum-mechanical models for granular materials. The speaker in his lecture will be suggesting how our anomalous observations may be explained  and comment on its relevance to the rheometry of granular materials. About the Speaker: Prof. Prabhu R.

Besides  our society is in need of sustainable cleaner technologies that can generate considerably less greenhouse gas emissions without impacting global climate change.  With a vision for a sustainable bio-based economy  DuPont has been making a great deal of efforts relentlessly over two decades on the development of bio-based products  materials and fuels using renewable sourced ingredients.  In driving towards this vision  we partnered with Genencor and Tate & Lyle and commercialized the ground breaking technology of the microbial production of 1 3-propanediol (BioPDO) in a recombinant E. Coli strain  and demonstrated the use of Bio PDO in many industrial and personal care applications. In 1950s  DuPont commercialized thermoplastic recyclable polyester  polyethylene terephthalate (PET)  using fossil fuel based feedstocks such as ethylene glycol and dimethyl terephthalate and branded as Dacron for fiber and Mylar for film.  Today PET is one of the world's most commonly used  versatile and trusted materials with a global demand of 20 million tonnes. 50 years later  we have developed specialty polymers such as Sorona (polytrimethylene terephthalate) polymer for fiber and 100% bio based polyether polyols using Bio PDO  instead of petrochemical propanediol. Today  this sustainable bio-based technology platform not only is bringing significant revenue (~$300 million per year) to the corporation but also helping to reduce the environmental footprints.  In this presentation  I will narrate how we have created this biomaterial platform using Bio-PDO as a building block successfully  and thereby helping to build the bio-based economy for the future. About the speaker: Dr. Sunkara is currently a Senior Principal Investigator in DuPont Industrial BioSciences Business unit. He received his Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry in 1989 from University of Madras  India.

Engg. Dept. Asbtract: A safe and secure future for humanity depends to a large  extent on the development of sustainable and economic  energy resources  and will  require  fundamental  science and engineering  contributions.  In this talk I will present  some of my work on  the  advancement of energy systems in electronics  oil and gas  and solar energy sectors. Cooling of electronic systems  particularly high performance data centers  is a  highly  energy intensive process. In 2013  data centers  consumed  about 100 billion kWh  of electricity  in  the U.S. alone and it is expected that by 2020  the carbon footprint of data centers will exceed that of the airline  industry.  One of the solutions  to reduce energy consumption is to move from conventional air cooling to liquid cooling   and in that respect  I will present  a  computer-aided molecular design  approach  for development of novel heat transfer fluids for  cooling of such systems. The fluids designed in this work not only possess superior heat transfer properties  but also significantly lower global warming potentials.  I will also present  a  critical  evaluation of nanoparticle dispersions (or  nanofluids)  for heat transfer applications  and  show  contrary to widely held  belief   the  effective thermal conductivity of  nanofluids  decreases with decreasing particle size. In conventional oil and gas industries  clathrate hydrates of natural gases  are  associated with many  energy transportation (‘flow assurance’)  related problems. However  gas hydrates also present a potential future energy resource  as it is estimated that more than 1015 m3 of natural gas is present in oceanic and permafrost gas hydrate deposits. I will present  some of my work on hydrate phase equilibria modeling   including the  application of  a quantum chemical approach   COSMO  and flowloop studies carried out at the Exxon-Mobil flowloop facility. I will also present my work related to the solar industry  which has been growing at a tremendous pace for the last 10-15 years. As the price of solar grade silicon has dropped from about $350/kg in 2008 to about $19/kg in 2015  there is a considerable need to advance and optimize process systems in  the  solar  industry.  I will present  a  few examples from manufacturing of silicon  for photovoltaic applications  and how a  lack of thermophysical property data on chlorosilanes and poor assumptions in process design affect the productivity of silicon.

The challenges are twofold: reducing greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate global warming and finding a renewable replacement for fossil fuels that is being depleted at an increasing rate.  Therefore the production of fuels from renewable resources is of great interest.  In this talk  I will focus on the production of fuels form biomass or biomass derived raw materials using thermochemical processes which employ a variety of catalytic steps in converting the biomass to fuels.  In this approach the biomass is first converted to syngas ( mixture of CO and H2) which then is converted to liquid hydrocarbon fuels using Fischer-Tropsch (FTS) catalysts. The challenges are economic in nature: how to convert the biomass on a small scale  while minimizing costs. I will address some recent advances in the design of improved catalysts for both reforming of biogases and for FTS liquefaction. Electronic structure calculations using Density Functional Theory (DFT) is used to shed light on reaction mechanisms and to screen catalyst promoters. Promoters can lower the temperature required for the reforming reactions while preventing deactivation. Micro scale modeling is used to design a core-shell architecture for FTS catalysts. By rational  systematic design one can enhance product selectivity  enhance conversion while lowering the temperature requirements. I will present experimental results from micro scale as well as bench scale catalyst testing. Bio: Dr. Joseph graduated from IIT/Kanpur with B.

Moreover  this reaction is the starting point for the development of catalytic palladium compounds. The elementary steps of this catalytic process involve ligand substitution  nucleophilic addition  b-hydrogen elimination and insertion  which are common to several other organometallic reactions. General mechanism of the Wacker oxidation is well known today  however  some of the elementary steps are under debate for more than four decades. The major controversy is associated with the nucleophilic addition (hydroxypalladation) of a water molecule on alkene  whether it proceeds by an inner sphere or by an outer sphere mechanism. Two different reaction routes have been proposed based on the modes of hydroxypalladation. The inner sphere reaction route involves a water molecule coordinated cis to the alkene involved in the nucleophilic attack to form the hydroxyethylpalladium intermediate. On the other hand  the outer sphere reaction pathway is based on an outer sphere water molecule attacking the alkene. Although  there are several experimental results that could be interpreted in the support of tale of two hydroxypalladations (inner sphere as well as outer sphere pathways)[1 2].One of the noted experiment along the oxidation of [D2]allylic1 1alcohol (1) to [D2]allylic3 3alcohol (2) was studied and  reported that isotopic scrambling of 1 to 2 does not take place during reaction[3 4]. This finding hints that hydroxypalladation proceeds through inner sphere mechanism. For understanding the genesis of parallel routes of hydroxypalladation proposed for the Wacker oxidation  We employed state of the art periodic density functional theory (DFT) based Car-Parrinello (CP) ab initio molecular dynamics simulation. Our simulations considered finite solvent water molecules along with catalyst and olefines (ethene and allyl alcohol) for predicting mechanism and kinetics. Herein  free-energy barriers were computed by using accelerated molecular dynamics technique (metadynamics) within the framework of Car-Parrinello Molecular Dynamics (CPMD). The crucial experimental results are revisited in this work and gives a picture on the mechanism and kinetics. In short  our results showed that hydroxypalladation occurs via outer sphere mechanism and  is in fact equilibrium nature. We proposed that rate determining step involves isomerization of Cl ligand in the hydroxypalladate complex  occurring prior to the bhydrogen transfer  thus explaining the absence of primary kinetic isotope effects in the hydrogen transfer steps. Moreover  we investigated isotopic scrambling of 1 to 2 does not occur within outer sphere mechanism of hydroxypalladation in our observed allyl alcohol mechanism by doing micro-kinetics.

Date and Time    - Friday  14/08/2015  4.00 pm Venue  -  Room # 118  Chem. Engg. Dept.  Abstract: The liquid phase in a supercooled state (i.e.  at a temperature below the melting temperature) eventually relaxes towards the stable crystal phase. The estimation of the properties of the supercooled liquid  close to the limit of metastability  could be challenging because of the fast relaxation process. The properties of the supercooled tetrahedral liquids (such as silicon and water) show unusual behaviour. One such well known anomaly is the increase in heat capacity as the  temperature is reduced. To understand the origin of such behavior  it is important to study in detail the equilibrium (i.e. average) properties and the statistical distributions of  these properties. In this work  we investigate the supercooled tetrahedral liquids of silicon and water (modelled using widely used empirical potentials) close to the limit of metastability. In case of supercooled silicon  we identify the equilibrium properties based on precise computation of Gibbs free energy (relative to the stable crystalline phase) by means of thermodynamic integration. Further we study the equilibrium distribution of potential energy of the supercooled liquid. We find that as the relaxation process initiates the distribution of potential energy develops a straight line region (SLR) with a configurational temperature close to 1060 K  which was identified as the freezing temperature of 4 coordinated particle network in an earlier study. We find that the equilibrium distribution is tangential to the SLR region. We attribute the increase in heat capacity (with supercooling) to the appearance of this straight line region in the potential energy distributions. In the second part of our work  we study the relaxation process in detail using supercooled water. The relaxation of supercooled liquid  at a macroscopic level  is generally described in the framework of classical nucleation theory. However in a deeply supercooled state  near the limit of metastability  inherent structures that influence the liquid properties may play an important role. We find that the relaxaion of the supercooled liquid is accompanied by a sharp change in the potential energy and density of the system  as well as a rapid increase in size of the 4 -coordinated particle network. During this process  the perparticle 2-body energy of the 4-coordinated network approaches the crystalline value very closely (with less than 0.35 % deviation)  while the per particle 3-body energy of the network approaches a value that shows a large (about 60--90 %) deviation with respect to the crystalline value. During relaxation  the fluctuations in the 2-body energy of the network decrease continuously  resulting in the tightening of the bonds  which is expected to reduce the mobility of the 4-coordinated particles. We describe this process as the freezing of the 4- coordinated particle network. Our work shows that close to the limit of metastability  the relaxation process may be better described  at a macroscopic level  in terms of average mechanical changes in the inherent structures (i.e. the 4-coordinated particle network in our case) that develop naturally in the liquid  as a result of supercooling.

Engg. Dept.   Abstract : The emergence of collective motion on large length scales is the hallmark of a wide variety of active living matter. Bird flocks  fish schools  bacterial swarms and etc are a few examples. The origin of this robust behavior lies in the microscopic interactions at the individual level. Due to complexity of the systems it is often challenging to measure and describe them theoretically. Here we have developed a model system of active colloidal rollers that allows a quantitative description of microscopic interactions between the particles. Under confinement these colloidal rollers are found to display self organisation in the form of a steadily rotating macroscopic vortex. The system undergoes a phase transition from an isotropic-gas phase to a heterogeneous polar-liquid vortex phase when the density of the rollers exceeds a critical density. We will present experimental results and theoretical arguments to support these observations. Towards the end of the talk  I will also present a few recent results on the anomalous diffusion of colloidal rollers in a heterogeneous media.

Materials with well-controlled particles/pores from a few nanometres to a few hundreds of nanometres are indispensable to solve many energy and environment related problems.This talk describes recent efforts in engineering such nano structures/porous solids with added extra functionalities for efficient Carbon (CO2) Capture and Energy (Hydrogen  Methane & Electrochemical) Storage. The research is focussed on multifunctional nanostructured materials  such as Metal–Organic Frameworks (MOFs)  Carbons (Activated  Templated  graphene-oxide-  MOF -& biomass-derived) and Hydrogen Storage Materials. Particularly demonstrated is a method of obtaining multifunctional carbons with highly tuneable and hierarchical pores of high surface area and ultra-high pore volume.The carbons show outstanding CO2 /Methane adsorption & electrochemical energy storage capacity. The CO2-philicamine impregnated carbon monoliths also show exceptional CO2 sorption  kinetics and stable cyclic capacities at the simulated flue-gas conditions  significantly outperforming any known sorbents reported to date.1 We also present a facile and effective method of enhancing CO2 uptake  binding  and selectivity of MOFs. Towards the end we show a strategy for high capacity with rapid kinetics of clean hydrogen generation from the nanostructured chemical hydrides by nano confinement within the stable MOF pores. Overall we aimed to enhance the structure - property relationships and such improvements can only be offered by innovations in materials.

Date and Time    - Wednesday 2nd September  Room 149  5pm Department of Chemical Engineering.   Abstract: The mechanics of motility of single microorganisms has held the fascination of physicists and engineers for a very long time. It is however only in 2005 that Hatwalne and Ramaswamy noted in a landmark article that self-propulsion of single cells must have interesting consequences for the overall mechanical behaviour of their suspensions. Since then  there has been an explosion of work on materials consisting of self-propelled particles or ``active matter"". And with good reason: understanding their properties appears to hold the key to understanding many complex biological processes. I shall present some of my group's current work in this area. The first concerns experiments testing a well known prediction of the theory for active matter  that motility of particles changes the macroscopic bulk viscosity of their suspensions. Qualitative predictions in the article by Hatwalne and Ramaswamy have been broadly verified in experiments with suspensions of swimming algae and bacteria. I shall discuss our attempts at making a more quantitative comparison using experiments with extensional flows. The second half of the talk will focus on a ongoing collaborative work with Sameer Jadhav. It is known that bacteria build complex communities on surfaces called biofilms. Some organisms such as the ""superbug"" Pseudomonas aeruginosa rapidly colonize surfaces as monolayers before developing into mature biofilms. Experiments suggest that P. aeruginosa may employ an intriguing strategy to manipulate interfacial instabilities to quickly overrun soft surfaces. I shall discuss a preliminary attempt at building a mathematical model of interfaces in active materials such as these bacterial colonies.

Abstract: Zeolites are microporous crystalline materials with well-defined  structures. Recently  much emphasis has been accorded to the synthesis   characterization and application of nanocrystalline zeolites  driven by  a wide choice of applications and the multitude of challenges they  present to materials scientists. They are promising materials for the  preparation of a variety of new and existing applications as in  catalysts  ion exchangers  sensors  optical devices  etc.. The particle  size of zeolites used for these applications is an important parameter.  The synthesis and characterization of different zeolite structure in  nanosized form are summarized. Special attention is given to zeolites  synthesized as stable fully-dispersible sol. The use of  fully-dispersible nanozeolites for the fabrication of hierarchical  porous structures and transparent zeolite film are described.

It is rampant throughout the world  across all age groups and its prevalence is found to be dependent on the sex  race and ethnicity. Current treatment regimen includes exercise  lifestyle changes and medications targeting individual components of the syndrome. The lack of efficacy of this regimen could be due to lack of systematic and holistic studies on MetS per se. The causes for MetS are varied and can be broadly categorised into genetic and environmental. Stress  physical inactivity and nutrition excess are key components of the environmental causes. In the current study  diet based approach was used to develop a suitable animal model which depicts the real situation seen in humans. MetS was induced in male C57BL/6J mice by feeding specially formulated energy dense High Fat Simple Carbohydrate (HFSC) feed for a period of 5 months. The test mice were hyperphagic; had increased feed efficiency; had significantly higher % increase in body weight  waist circumference as compared to control at the end of the study. The test mice were also hyperglycaemic with impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance; hypercholesterolemic and hypertriglyceridemic as compared to the control. Further systematic studies on central (brain) and peripheral (plasma and urine) monoamine metabolic pathways revealed that the test mice had lower central(hypothalamic) Serotonergic tone as compared to the control. The test mice were also seen to have significantly lower central (hypothalamic) and peripheral (urine) dopaminergic and significantly higher central(hypothalamic) and peripheral (plasma and urine) Noradrenergic (Norepinephrine) tone as compared to the control crediting Dopamine and Norepinephrine to be used as markers for detection of the syndrome. These results indicate high sympathetic activity and altered Hypothalamic activity. Hyperleptinemia and hyperprolactinemia along with higher levels of cortisol were observed in the test as compared to the control indicating perturbation of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis. The observed altered carbohydrate and lipid metabolism  monoamine metabolic pathway and HPA axis in the test pointed towards a possible role of a nuclear receptor  Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor (PPAR) subtypes γ and β/δ. In an attempt to ameliorate the syndrome  novel antagonists against PPAR γ and agonists against PPAR β/δ were identified using an in silico (docking) approach.

Venue & date: Room CL 118 Chemical Engineering Department Friday 09th Oct 2.30pm Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic progressive movement disorder due to loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra  pars  compacta region of mid brain.The present study was carried out to evaluate the protective effect of Valeriana wallichii rhizome extract against MPP+  treated in vitro and MPTP treated in vivo models of Parkinson’s disease. Qualitative analysis of the aqueous  ethanolic and methanolic extracts of V. wallichii rhizome were carried out which indicated the presence of flavonoids  phenols glycosides  terpinoids and  tannins.HPTLC quantification  showed  that  the  methanolic extract  of  V.  wallichii rhizome  has  highest  amount  of  hesperidin.  Subsequent  studies  were carried  out  with  the methanolic extract of V. wallichii rhizome (VWE). Analysis of VWE by GC-MS speculated the presence of acacetin  valeric acid  homovannelic acid etc. VWE showed in vitro radical scavenging activities  reductive ability.VWE exhibited IC 50  value at 2.207 mg/mL for SH-SY5Y cells. In SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells  treated  with  neurotoxin  MPP+  or  ER  stress  inducer tunicamycin   time  and  dose dependent effect of VWE was analysed. VWE at a concentration of 1000µg/mL protected the SH-SY5Y cells. As evidenced by morphological staining  VWE exhibited ROS scavenging activity  prevented apoptotic cell death and inhibited mitochondrial. For in vivo experiments  C57BL/6 male mice treated with sub chronic level of MPTP were used as PD model. Following MPTP treatment behavioural studies were performed. PD mice were  treated  orally  with  3 different  doses  of  VWE  for  2  weeks. The  mid  brain regions/striatum  was  used  for  analysing  various  parameters  and  for histopathological analysis.  VWE  improved  the  behavioral  test  scores   increased  the striatal  dopamine   mid brain  tyrosine  hydroxylase  levels   reduced  GFAP   ROS   LPO  levels  MAO-B  activity  and increased the GSH levels  antioxidant enzyme activities in a dose dependent manner in PD mice. Also VWE restrained the MPTP induced histopathological changes in mid brain region of  PD  mice.  Optimum  dose  fixed  from  the  results  observed  was used  for  further  studies. VWE effectively reduced the inflammatory markers  regulated the apoptotic and ER stress markers. In silico molecular docking studies of selective components of VWE with MAO-B  iNOS  and  PERK  showed  that   acacetin  interacted  better  with  MAO-B whereas  hesperidin exhibited best binding efficiency with iNOS and PERK. Data  obtained  in  this  study  indicates  the  potential  of  VWE  to reduce  MPTP  induced  PD. While this may be attributed to the synergistic effects of various phytocompounds present in it  the potential of hesperidin  on important selective markers emphasize its therapeutic value. Thus  Valeriana wallichii and its bioactive compounds can serve as potential leads for the development of several new drugs for treating PD.

Abstract: Crude oil and natural gas form an integral part of energy resources. Their contribution to the energy basket is significant and is predicted to grow in the future. This demands exploring and developing unconventional hydrocarbon resources  such as shale gas  gas hydrate and heavy oil reservoirs  in addition to enhancing the recovery from the conventional mature oil reservoirs. Gas hydrates have always inspired researchers for their role in flow assurance. However  gas hydrates show potential not only as an abundant energy resource  but also for developing new oil and gas technologies such as natural gas storage and transportation  gas separation  desalination and CO2 sequestration. Phase behavior models are necessary for predicting the hydrate phase stability conditions for successful engineering applications. New phase behavior models for the gas hydrate system in the presence of various inhibitors and promoters along with selected experimental studies will be presented. Experimental studies on the kinetics of hydrate formation and dissociation in porous media and saline environment relevant for gas recovery and CO2 sequestration will be discussed. Recent developments on the high-pressure rheology of the pure methane hydrate system will also be presented. Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods  such as chemical  thermal and microbial-EOR  need further development for waxy and heavy crude oil reservoirs. Nanotechnology may offer solutions for next-generation oil and gas technologies. Nanoparticles have been explored to improve the thermal stability and high pressure rheological properties of Pickering oil/water emulsion. The thermally stable emulsions have been evaluated in the laboratory as an efficient flooding agent for an EOR method. Nanoparticles in the form of nanofluids in xanthan gum have also been found to improve the thermal stability  high pressure rheological and fluid loss properties of the water based drilling fluids. In addition  evaluation of ionic liquids for heavy crude oil dissolution and chemical-EOR method will be discussed. Selected results on the microbial degradation of long-chain hydrocarbons and waxy crude oil relevant for flow assurance and microbial-EOR will be presented.

Abstract: Membrane technology is going to play a more and more important role in the era of renewable energy since harvest of renewable energy from their sources often impose much higher challenges for separation. For example  processes such as CO2 capture  separation of natural gas  harvest of biofuel or hydrogen  etc. all require high efficient but low cost separation processes which can be hardly achieved by conventional separation techniques. From the other hand  membrane technology has been proven their feasibility in large-scale processes such as seawater desalination as a cost and energy efficient separation technology.  Development of novel membrane materials is often a key to develop high efficient membranes. For example  membranes made from inorganic porous materials with uniform pore size  such as zeolites  have demonstrated excellent separation performances over conventional polymeric membranes. However  inorganic porous materials are often suffered from their limited topological framework structures and chemical flexibility. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs)  as a new class of ordered porous materials with an inorganic-organic hybrid structure  are able to achieve rational designs in both structure and functionalities  and have showed high thermal stability. Hence  it can be a very promising type of membrane materials. In this talk we will discuss the synthesis methods for preparation of high quality MOF membranes  and their prospective applications in separation of hydrocarbon mixtures  such as C2/C3 and olefin/paraffin mixtures.

Venue & date: Room CL 118 Chemical Engineering Department  Monday 19th Oct 5.00pm.  Abstract: Detection of somatic mutations in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes using whole-exome sequencing (WES) is hampered by the high polymorphism of the HLA loci  which prevents alignment of sequencing reads to the human reference genome. We describe a computational pipeline that enables accurate inference of germline alleles of class I HLA-A  B and C genes and subsequent detection of mutations in these genes using the inferred alleles as a reference. Analysis of WES data from 7 930 pairs of tumor and healthy tissue from the same patient revealed 298 nonsilent HLA mutations in tumors from 266 patients. These 298 mutations are enriched for likely functional mutations  including putative loss-of-function events. Recurrence of mutations suggested that these 'hotspot' sites were positively selected. Cancers with recurrent somatic HLA mutations were associated with upregulation of signatures of cytolytic activity characteristic of tumor infiltration by effector lymphocytes  supporting immune evasion by altered HLA function as a contributory mechanism in cancer.

Venue & date: Skype seminar in HOD conference room  Chemical Engineering Department Wednesday  21st Oct  9.30 am. Abstract: This research seminar highlights the research experience of the author while pursuing graduate studies  and largely covers the authorâ€™s PhD research on Joule heating effects in insulator-based dielectrophoresis microdevices. The seminar will also include a very brief overview of a few studies on electrokinetic instability and magnetophoretic effects in microfluidic devices  which are co-advised by the author during PhD studies. The presentation will be concluded by the proposed post-doctoral work at IIT Bombay. An introduction to the PhD research is provided below. Lab on a chip (LoC) systems have been extensively applied for manipulation  detection and analysis of samples  in various fields like medical diagnostics  biotechnology  chemistry  environmental monitoring  food technology  and water quality control. Dielectrophoresis  the motion of a polarizable species induced by electric field gradients  is a highly selective label-free electrokinetic method extensively used to achieve a controlled manipulation of samples. Specifically  insulator-based dielectrophoresis has been exploited for manipulating species more over the other dielectrophoretic methods  due to its simpler and cheaper fabrication and absence of electrode fouling in the vicinity of the region of sample manipulation. However  the stronger electric fields required in this method make the concerned microdevices highly susceptible to Joule heating which inevitably exists in all electrokinetic methods. Joule heating has been extensively demonstrated to induce non-uniformities in temperature dependent fluid properties and adversely affect the sample manipulation in capillary electrophoresis and electrode based dielectrophoretic microdevices. In addition  the permittivity gradients induced by heating have also been extensively shown to induce electrothermal flows in electrode based dielectrophoretic microdevices. However  very little attention has been given to the Joule heating effects in insulator based dielectrophoresis microdevices  despite the necessity of considering the same being critical while designing LoC systems employing this mechanism. In addition  the previously reported literature on the numerical simulations of these effects has been two dimensional. Since the temperature field induced by Joule heating extends beyond the fluid domain into the microfluidic substrates  three dimensional simulations are expected to provide a more accurate interpretation of the joule heating effects. This research expands the studies on Joule heating effects in insulator-based dielectrophoresis microdevices. Experimental studies and a qualitative theoretical analysis have been provided to understand the exact role of Joule heating in influencing the mechanism of insulator based dielectrophoresis. The numerical analysis involved in the work studies a coupled transport of charge  mass  momentum and energy  and is based on a full scale  three dimensional transient simulation of the entire microdevice in COMSOL Multiphysics  which has been developed by the author for the first time in this field.

Time & Venue : 5:15 pm at Main Auditorium  Victor Menezes Convention Centre.   Abstract: Development and mainstreaming of Sustainable Technology- End use Packages (STEPs) has been an important stream of work in supporting sustainable development in the long run. The talk is an elaboration of challenges experienced by the speaker in developing and mainstreaming STEPs divided broadly under the categories: solar heating and natural cooling; small  micro and rural enterprises; small power; and waste utilization. Integrating resource variability  efficiency  emissions  convenience and cost with a particular end use or application is an engineering challenge in itself  requiring different disciplines. In addition  experiences so far show that there are even bigger challenges related to development of a final product  finding credible manufacturers  and creating mechanisms for repair  maintenance etc. Mainstreaming challenges for several STEPs remained more or less same over several decades  due to factors such as difficulties in establishing marketing channels  indifference of governments and financial institutes  and changing user mind sets. Development of STEPs had been  and most likely will be  largely driven by individuals and by a few entrepreneurs with limited support by institutes  but the existing institutional structures do not seem to be either interested or capable of providing adequate support to such efforts over long periods. Also  as the information on past attempts is limited  scattered or not documented properly  it seems that re-inventions do happen  only again to fall into a circle of product development  marketing etc. Several questions come to the fore on how promising innovators  entrepreneurs and others committed to the idea of sustainable development can get adequate support in the form of knowledge  advice  finance etc. Some suggestions and open thoughts in this regard will be presented.

Venue & date: Room 118  Department of Chemical Engineering. Thursday 19th November 5-6pm  Abstract: Unique characteristics of the nanoscale object drawn the attention of research  community to create novel properties and look for possibilities to solve world’s arising problems ranging from hunger to medicine.In the present research work  nanomaterials ranging from metal and metal oxide  to  advanced  graphene  nanostructure were  synthesized with  independent  control  over shape   size   composition   surface  properties   and  crystal  phase  using  aerosol  sol-gel and biosynthesis approaches. Applications including system biology of nanomedicine  drug delivery  nano-nutrient  and  nanosensor  for  sustainable  livelihoodwere  explored.In  nanomedicine   we developed morphologically controlled 100 nm vaterite nanoparticles as a pH neutralizer for cancer therapy. The novel concept of extracellular pH environment modulator controls the tumor growth.  An attempt was made to develop an aerosol-baseddrug delivery to the brain by axonal transport.  Findings of the experiment carried out on the locust. It is observed that 5 nm  sphere shape  gold nanoparticles  functionalized with thiol group can be transported to locust brain by the aerosol-based delivery approach. This insight finding is the evidence for axonal transport of nanoparticles to the brain that may  help  to  deliver the drug in  an  effective  manner.    Besides  nanomedicine  malnutrition and  food  availability  is a major problem  for  the  growing  about 7.8 billion  world population.  In this direction  nanonutrient fertilizer was developed to enhance crop production by harvesting  more  sunlight  and  native  nutrient  mobilization  in  the  rhizosphere. Nanonutrient improves chlorophyll and  protein  content  in  plant  leaves   biomass production and nutritional content in the ripened fruit.  Novel nano-fertilizer not only reduces the demands of conventional chemical  fertilizers  and  save  natural resources but  also  improve  human  health  by  producing nutrition  rich  food  products.    In  addition  to nanomedicine  and  nanofood   it  is  very  important  to detect and eradicate disease-causingagent. Thus  highly sensitive graphene-based nanosensor  nanopesticides and engineered water nanostructure was developed. In the mirror view of nano-biotechnology   toxicity  or undesirable impact  of technology can’t  be  ignored. Therefore  environmental   toxicity and   impact   assessment based   on   nanoparticles   morphology   and composition of nanomaterials was studied. Eco-toxicity on the terrestrial and aquatic environment is investigated  and factor for nanoparticles accumulation  agglomeration  aggregation  interaction with bio-interface and fate of nanoparticles was also determined.

Thermodynamic  analysis has been used for enhancing the resource use and reducing  environmental impact for many national economies. From the national  metabolism studies it has been observed that the economic progress of  society can be well defined on the basis of the exergy of resource  consumed and its conversion to useful work. Aim of this work is to give  an understanding of the metabolism of India over the last four decades  (from 1970 to 2010) as it evolved from a controlled to more open free  market economy  and its implication for sustainable development. Trends  of resource consumption and its conversion into useful work are analyzed  using exergy analysis and the results are compared with those of other  developing and developed economies. Part-II:  This work also compares the waste management practices of  incineration  plasma gasification  and land filling based on their  exergy loss and efficiency  and emissions.

Stringent emission regulations are being imposed by several countries to reduce the harmful emissions from mobile and stationary sources. Monolithic catalysts have been widely used for air pollution abatement due to their several advantages such as high heat and mass transport rates per unit pressure drop  smaller transverse temperature gradients and ease of scale-up. This seminar covers fundamental aspects of optimal design of monolithic catalysts as well as an overview of state-of-the-art technologies for air pollution abatement. Monolithic catalyst consists of a large number of long  narrow channels (of hydraulic diameter about 1 mm) in parallel through which reacting fluid flows and the catalyst is deposited in the form of a washcoat (of average thickness ~ 40 µm) on the monolith channel wall. The reactants diffuse transverse to the flow direction in the gas phase and through the porous washcoat where they react and the products formed diffuse back into the gas phase. Therefore  the detailed mathematical model consists of a system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) along with highly nonlinear reaction source/sink terms. Although the numerical solution of such detailed models is possible with the present day computers  it may be demanding in terms of time and memory requirements  especially for real time simulations that may be needed in the control and optimization schemes. Therefore  we develop simplified low-dimensional models having same qualitative behavior as the full PDE models and sufficient accuracy for practical applications. These are derived directly by averaging the governing equations and using the concepts of inter and intra-phase mass transfer coefficients. It is shown that the low-dimensional model is more general and superior to the classical two-phase model which use the effectiveness factor concept. These new models are robust and accurate with practically acceptable error  speed up the computations by orders of magnitude  and can be used with confidence for the real time simulation and control of monolithic catalysts. Further  we develop analytical criteria for determining the transition boundary between the operating regimes (such as kinetic  washcoat diffusion and external mass transfer controlled) in catalytic monoliths in terms of various reactor and operating parameters. The second part of work elaborates various state-of-the-art experimental techniques utilized for analyzing performance and optimal design of catalytic monoliths. Specifically  we demonstrate the use of spatially resolving measurement techniques (Spaci-FTIR) to analyze the distributed performance along the length of a monolithic Cu-zeolite SCR catalyst. The technique was used to study SCR zone length and ammonia storage. The significant finding is that the NH3 storage is nearly complete in the SCR zone and no significant storage occurs beyond the SCR zone. Thus the catalyst utilization can be determined using the fractional storage under the SCR reaction conditions. These findings were utilized for model development  catalyst design and control.

He received his B.Chem.Engg. degree from ICT  Mumbai in 2004.

Abstract: Development of microscale equipment is mainly focused on reaction  mixing and heat transfer; however for implementation in the process industry also separation is required. In particular  equipment is missing that suits (i) the integration in a full-flow chain (ii) and production capacities of kilo- and pilot-labs in industry  which amounts to product- and solvent flows of 1-10 kg/day and 10-100 l/day. Our device COILED FLOW INVERTER (CFI) which enhances mixing by inverting the flow due to 90 degree bend was recently tested for immiscible Liquid-liquid extraction performance at TU Eindhoven with model systems given by European Federation of Chemical Engineering of acetone-water-toluene and acetone-water-butyl-acetate. Partition coefficient were calculated and compared with the value at thermodynamic equilibrium. The performance of CFI device was further tested for metal extraction which is significant for removal of metal catalyst from the product especially for pharmaceutical substances. Copper scavenging experiments were performed using chelating agents with the initial setup. The use of different types of copper catalysts and metal scavengers were investigated together with variation of metal scavenger concentration and pH. Such analysis allowed achieving excellent extraction efficiency up to 99% enabling to meet the limit for APIs of 15 ppm in single stage of separation. CFI was used in our own department for continuous refolding of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF)  a biotech therapeutic product. The performance of the continuous refolding protocol has been compared with an optimized batch refolding protocol. It has been demonstrated that enhanced mixing allows for operation at higher protein concentrations (0.38 mg/ml as compared to 0.19 mg/ml in batch) and results in comparable purity (84% vs. 83% in batch)  thereby resulting in a significant reduction of costs related to downstream purification. Our developed COILED FLOW INVERTER device has been successfully demonstrated by other internationally recognised schools for its application in  microreactor technology  such as extraction  polymerization and biotechnology. I am encouraged to share our COILED FLOW INVERTER innovation at IIT Bombay with a view to further explore the possibility of its application to different areas.

Globular proteins aggregates at low pH and their self-assembly causes the formation of amyloid like protein fibrils. We investigated snapshots of the fibrillation and aggregation kinetics of multi-stranded β-lactoglobulin amyloid protein fibrils by combining scattering (SANS  DLS  DDLS) as well as atomic force microscopy (AFM). Here  I will emphasize a novel technology in which hybrid membranes made from β-lactoglobulin protein fibrils and porous carbon for the treatment of water contaminated with heavy metals  metal cyanides or radioactive substances. During filtration  the concentration of heavy metal ions drops by three to five orders of magnitude per passage and the process can be repeated numerous times. The protein fibrils in the composite membrane play the main role of sequestering heavy metal pollutants from the liquid. Importantly  these protein fibrils also allow the reduction of membrane-immobilized metal ions into valuable metal nanoparticles or thin films at elevated temperatures or via chemical routes  turning a global risk challenge into a unique opportunity. These β-lactoglobulin fibrils act as build blocks to prepare hybrid inorganic nanomaterials through biomineralization process. Inorganic hybrid materials have extraordinary physical properties such as conductive  magnetic and optical properties  and can serve multiple functional applications  ranging from optoelectronics  food fortification and catalysis. The hybrid protein membranes for the continuous flow catalytic membrane applications will be discussed in detail.

Venue: Room 118  Chemical Engineering   Abstract: The first step in the treatment of any pathological condition is its diagnosis. Currently  most medical diagnostic tests are conducted in centralized labs using bulky and expensive instruments that require trained users to operate. This infrastructure-heavy model of acquiring medical diagnostic information restricts access to proper medical diagnosis for many  especially in the developing world. In this talk  I will present a new vision of medical diagnostic testing in which state-of-the-art diagnostic tests are miniaturized into handheld devices that can be operated by untrained users. I will present proof-of-concept that this can be accomplished by using “paper-based microfluidics” (PµF). In PµF devices  fluids flow under capillary pressure generated by porous materials  which eliminates the need for bulky pumps to drive fluids. Our goal was to develop a fully automatic and disposable nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) device that can be operated by an untrained user. In a NAAT  the patient sample goes through sequential physical and chemical treatment steps and the net outcome is generation of billions of copies of the target DNA or RNA. In this sense  it is much like a ‘chemical process’ comprising of multiple unit operations  conducted in different zones of a PµF device  which are connected by ‘valves’. Valving in the absence of electricity or batteries in PµF devices was initially a challenge. I will present several new power-free valving strategies for PµF devices that enable conducting automatic multi-step fluidic operations. I will then briefly describe the molecular biology of isothermal strand displacement amplification (iSDA)  a method of amplifying DNA and RNA targets. I will present a simple kinetic model of iSDA that demonstrates the competition between specific and non-specific amplification reactions and helps improve theoretical understanding of the molecular mechanism. Finally  I will present one approach to designing a fully automated sample-to-answer NAAT device that fits in the palm of your hand. This technology has the potential to reduce the cost of and increase access to molecular diagnostic testing globally. About the speaker: Dr. Bhushan J.

I will show how the accessibility of reactive amino acid side chains present on the surface of globular proteins provides a spatially organized chemical platform for integrating hybrid components that can then be used to tune various biomaterial properties via site-specific surface functionalization. Specifically  I will present my recent work on the synthesis and characterization of single-component stoichiometric protein-polymer surfactant conjugates that melt at ambient temperatures to form solvent-free liquids with protein concentrations as high as 20-25 wt.%.1 2 These novel protein biofluids offer remarkable benefits over aqueous protein dispersions  including exceptionally high concentrations of protein molecules  remarkable levels of thermal stability (half denaturation temperatures of around 160 °C)  persistent protein dynamics and sustained biological functions. For example  reversible redox transitions have been demonstrated in solvent-free myoglobin melts 1 2 and enzyme activity reported in solvent-free liquid lipases.3 Working on solvent-free liquid myoglobin and lipase  I also developed an experimental methodology that resulted in the first known examples of enzymatically active self-standing hydrogel films obtained from the hierarchical assembly of protein-polymer surfactant bio-conjugates.4 This work represented the first example of metamaterial like behaviour obtained from protein based films.5 1.

This offers a novel route for the fabrication of nano and meso scale patterns. The limitation however is  such instability patterns are random and isotropic. We have been exploring possibilities of aligning these instability patterns by laterally confining the evolution pathway on a topographically patterned substrate. We have looked into the fundamental issue related to the morphology of an as cast film on a topographically patterned substrate and observed that depending on the wettability of the substrate by the casting solvent  a continuous film forms only above a critical solution concentration (ACS AMI 2012). In fact it is possible to obtain extremely well ordered structures for lower concentrations. We have extended this concept to obtain a novel alternate polymer droplet array (Nano Letters  2014). I may also highlight some of our recent work on the dewetting of a thin polymer bilayer on a topographically patterned substrate  that leads to extremely complex well ordered structures (Macromolecules 2013; Nanoscale 2016). We will also discuss how utilizing the essential concepts of Soft Lithography and Stress Relaxation  we could come up with a novel nano patterning technique that allows fabrication of patterns with different feature height from a single stamp (ACS Macro Lett.  2013). We extended this approach for fabricating a topography gradient surface (ACS AMI 2014)  that allowed us to perform various combinatorial dewetting studies (ACS AMI  2012). We are presently engaged in developing a method that allows fabrication of tall nano structures from a shallow stamp  based on the concept of bonding debonding hysteresis observed in contact instability of thin soft elastic films.

Biomass can be converted to energy by physical  biological and thermochemical processes; of which pyrolysis is one of the most promising and burgeoning technology to obtain liquid fuels. However  there are several challenges before liquid fuels from pyrolysis can be economically at par with fossil fossils. Biomass is mainly composed of the biopolymer cellulose; therefore  understanding of cellulose pyrolysis chemistries is important for efficiently modeling and optimizing pyrolysis reactors. In this seminar  I will present the results of modeling studies we performed to understand conversion of crystalline cellulose to precursors of major products during pyrolysis. Cellulose when subjected to heat undergoes structural transformation at ~400K. I will discuss the role of intrachain and interchain hydrogen bonding in this transformation. At temperatures > 550K cellulose undergoes chemical transformation to a variety of products—distribution of which depends on temperature and residence time.  We modeled the decomposition of cellulose at 600 and 873 K using Car-Parrinello molecular-dynamics and the metadynamics method. CPMD-metadynamics implemented with various sets of collective variables yielded a variety of chemical reactions such as depolymerization  fragmentation  ring opening  and ring contraction. I will discuss why levoglucosan (LGA) is the major product observed during cellulose pyrolysis at higher temperatures (~873 K) and the bottleneck to formation of LGA. The molecular insights from this research can be used to develop a detailed picture of cellulose pyrolysis paving way for better design of such processes.

By sensing and interpreting neuronal activities to actuate an external device  BMI-based neuroprostheses hold great promise in rehabilitating motor impaired subjects such as amputees. Over the past two decades  research efforts have mainly been directed towards designing BMIs which rely on the available visual feedback and cortical learning for the movement corrections and thus the design and incorporation of proprioceptive and tactile feedback pathways have completely been ignored. In the absence of these feedback pathways  BMIs fail to differentiate visually similar textures and are unable to provide a complete cortical control over the robotic arm. Recently  it has been recognized in BMIs community that the inclusion of sensory feedback from the robotic arm to the brain in BMIs is necessary to improve the versatility of BMI-based neuroprostheses. In this talk  I will present a design of artificial sensory (proprioceptive) feedback in an optimal control framework towards developing next generation feedback-enabled closed-loop BMIs. In the first part  I will discuss our model predictive control framework in designing artificial proprioceptive feedback for a single-joint movement task. I will emphasize the degradation in the BMI performance in the absence of natural proprioception and show the natural recovery of the BMI motor task within our developed theoretical framework. The second part of the talk will focus on quantitative assessment of the Izhikevich single neuron model  the building block of cortical circuit models  using (in-vivo like) experimental data. I will conclude the talk by outlining my future research directions.

Date: Thursday  31st March  1700-1800 Venue: Room 118  Chemical Engineering  Abstract: The traditional biomedical researcher’s toolkit  which relies on a molecular description of health and disease  often fails to address the healthcare challenges of our times.  For instance  despite the billions of dollars spent over the last 35 years and with the development of over 40 drugs  HIV cannot be eradicated from an infected individual today.  A systems approach  drawn from the physical and engineering sciences  can provide new insights leading to the resolution of many of these challenges.  In this talk  I will describe an example from our recent work where we have employed principles from chemical and biological engineering to resolve an outstanding question in medicine.  The problem involves the infection of humans by the hepatitis C virus  which current medicines cannot always cure.  To understand why and when the medicines fail  we examined the underlying processes that define the competition between the virus and our immune system.  Intriguingly  the resulting system of interactions behaves in a manner analogous to non-isothermal stirred tank reactors that are widely used in chemical engineering practice.  Borrowing from the classical analysis of such reactors  we unravelled not only the reasons for the failure of current medicines to treat hepatitis C  but also a strategy to improve response rates.

To leave the primary tumor  cancer cells lose cell-cell adhesion and gain migration and invasion to enter the bloodstream – a process called Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). Upon reaching a distant organ  they regain cell-cell adhesion and lose migration – a process called Mesenchymal to Epithelial Transition (MET). I will present an integrated theoretical and experimental approach that elucidates how cancer cells undergo EMT and MET  and how these transitions affect the ability of cancer cells to initiate new tumors at a distant organ. By mathematically modeling the core genetic circuit that regulates EMT/MET  we predicted that in addition to being epithelial (no migration  high adhesion) and mesenchymal (high migration  no adhesion)  cancer cells can stably adopt a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) state (both migration and adhesion) too that enables them to migrate collectively. We also identified how cancer cells maintain their hybrid E/M state; these predictions were later validated in experiments on H1975 lung cancer cells. Finally  by modeling the EMT/MET circuit with that responsible for tumor-initiation ability  we predicted that cells in a hybrid E/M state can form much more tumors as compared to mesenchymal cells  a prediction that is corroborated by recent experimental and clinical data in many cancers. Our integrated experimental-theoretical approach identifies multiple advantages that a hybrid E/M state offers during cancer metastasis and tumor initiation  and proposes novel potential targets that can disturb collective migration of cancer cells and push them out of this hybrid E/M state  thereby halting metastatic progression. Layman’s abstract: 90% of all cancer related deaths happen because cancer spreads to different organs of the body. Cancer cells spread by leaving the primary tumor individually or collectively  entering the blood circulation to travel throughout the body  and exiting at distant organs to seed new tumors there. How do cancer cells leave the tumor? When they leave  what prepares them to survive in a distant ‘foreign’ organ and start new tumors there? I will present how wet-bench experiments can be integrated with mathematical models of genetic networks regulating cancer cell migration to foster a new understanding of these clinically relevant questions. We show that how can cells move collectively stably  and how can their collective migration be disturbed. We also indicate that cells moving collectively are more likely to start a new tumor  a prediction that is supported by recent experimental and clinical data. Our results offer a predictive quantitative framework to understand cancer cell migration  and propose potential targets to curb metastasis.

Venue :Room 118  Chemical Engineering Date: Thursday  June 23  5 PM Abstract: Effective delivery of drugs is a major problem in today’s healthcare. At a fundamental level  the challenge of drug delivery reflects the fact that the drug distribution in the body is limited by body’s natural metabolic processes and transport barriers. These biological barriers  while serving an important purpose of regulating body’s metabolic functions  limit the drug dose that ultimately reaches the target site. Accordingly  many drugs fail to reach their full therapeutic potential. Our research aims at developing a fundamental understanding of body’s key biological barriers such as skin and intestinal epithelium  and utilizing this understanding to develop novel means to negotiate these barriers to deliver drugs. Human skin is one of the most sophisticated and well-engineered biological barriers in the human body. In principle  it offers an ideal interface to administer drugs into the body through the use of a transdermal patch. However  its formidable barrier properties limit the drug dose that can enter the body. Our research has led to the understanding of how skin’s structure and transport properties can be modulated using external stimuli such as ultrasonic waves  fluid microjets and amphiphiles  and how these stimuli can be controlled to enable transdermal delivery of drugs that were once thought undeliverable. We have also extended the lessons learned from our skin exploration to understand and negotiate other biological barriers in the body  in particular intestinal epithelium  reticuloendothelial system and tumors. Using transdermal-inspired approaches  we have advanced ways to understand and enhance drug delivery across the intestinal epithelium via oral route using patches. We have also designed patches that can be delivered within the body using circulatory cells such as red blood cells and macrophages by navigating through the internal biological barriers of the liver  lung  brain and tumors. I will present an overview of the lessons learned from our exploration of these biological barriers.

Additionally  the exercise of model development and application can lead to a greater understanding of the chemistry and physics of the system which can help to optimize their efficiency  and better control of the process.

Date: 28-th July  Thursday Time: 5:00-6:00 PM Venue: Seminar Hall  Rm. No. 118  Ground floor  Chemical Engg. Dept. (Attendance compulsory for CL702 students)  Abstract: The free energy of an interface formed between two condensed phases  such as a crystal and its melt  or between a condensed phase and a solid substrate is an important parameter governing the growth and nucleation of a crystal from its melt  the wetting behavior of a crystal near a wall and many other interfacial phenomena. However  a direct determination of the free-energy is not possible in experiments and indirectly the available estimates are unreliable. In this talk  I present a computational method to determine this quantity from molecular simulations and obtain conditions under which a crystal partially wets a wall  an information which is essential to investigate heterogeneous nucleation. In the second part of my talk  I use the simulation technique to compute the excess free energy of a supercooled liquid in contact with amorphous walls  having the same structure as the liquid. Such systems are studied to validate theories pertaining to a bulk supercooled liquid  in the context of the glass transition problem. Our results indicate that one has to be careful while interpreting the interfacial behavior as being representative of the bulk liquid.

No. 118  Ground floor  Chemical Engg. Dept.  Abstract:   Electrowetting (EW) on dielectric is one of the most convenient techniques accepted for manipulation of liquid droplets in micro-fluidic chips  as also in adaptive optics and POC devices. The external voltage brings electric charge density at a liquid-solid interface  which results in changing of wetting angle as a function of voltage magnitude. In normal circumstances  a water-hydrophobic polymer shows formation of electric double layer (EDL) due to preferential adsorption of water ions at liquid-solid interface. It is believed that  it has negligible effect on total capacitance in electrowetting system. Despite this fact  charge trapping related modification in EW contact angle modulation is seen on water-aged hydrophobic surfaces. So far  the charge trapping can be controlled by means of suitable voltage bias in EW. Also effect of water-ion contact on hydrophobic surface may lead to electro-hydrodynamic instability induced nano-structuration  which is not yet fully understood. References: 1.

Venue : Room 118  Chemical Engineering  Abstract:  With advances in nano/biosciences  there has been a  prominent shift towards miniaturization of technology which has become  an integral part of our everyday life. Nano/Micromotors (also referred  to as nano/microbots) is a relatively new concept involving  self-propelled autonomous microstructures that can be manipulated within  aqueous environments for diverse applications like environmental sensing  and remediation  site-directed drug delivery and cell/tissue  manipulation  among others. These artificial nano/micromotors can be  regarded as mechanical assemblies of certain specified geometries that  convert chemical/external energy into mechanical motion (similar to a  macroscopic motor  but they do so under the physical and chemical  constraints that are present at very small length scales). These nano/microbots have tremendous potential towards the future of  biomedical sciences  among others possessing active carrier properties  with better analyte capturing  capacity to manipulate cells or to  transport cargo (like drugs)  environmental sensing and remediation.  This talk aims to highlight the recent advances in the area of smart  materials for biomedical and environmental applications. I will provide  a basic introduction of this technology followed by some interesting  cases highlighting how these nano/microsystems can be used towards the  very future of our technology. This approach generally involves the  fabrication of a multi-component nano/micro systems coupled with high  aspect-ratio microstructures so as to provide two vital features: (1)  Autonomous or guided propulsion with the ability to control trajectory  (e.g.  steer under the influence of external fields/gradients); (2)  Applied aspects pertaining to chemical or biological activity (e.g.   stimulated drug release  optical sensing  cell surface binding for cell  manipulation). Owing the multidisciplinary nature of my research  we  will discuss a range of coherently linked topics involving  chemistry-materials-cellular biology. I will present some results from our recent paper on ‘Medibots’ which  is a dual-action biohybrid micromotor capable of performing microsurgery  at a cellular-level together with drug delivery properties. These  drug-loaded micromotors facilitate localized micromanipulation of a  single-cell (HeLa cells) followed by the sustained release of an  anti-cancer drug (Camptothecin)  thereby combining the feature of  non-invasive surgery together with a targeted-drug release capability.  We will also present our recent findings in the area of environmental  remediation highlightening the first of its kind wastewater activated  microbots for water remediation. These next-generation hybrid  micromotors are fabricated by growing catalytically active Pd particles  over thin-metal films (Ti/Fe/Cr)  which are then rolled-up into  self-propelled tubular microjets. The improved intermixing ability of the micromotors caused faster degradation ca.10 times higher  as compared to its non-motile counterpart. Finally  I will present my prospective research plan in the area of  smart materials and nano/micromotor technology. This talk serves as an  introduction to integrative nanotechnology with an aim to highlight the  ‘blue sky’ approach it tends to offer. Bio:  Dr. Sarvesh Kumar Srivastava is a visiting postdoctoral fellow  under the aegis of MIT-DBT postdoctoral programme at IIT-B  India. He  has recently completed his postdoc tenure at the IFW  Dresden  Germany  where he independently developed his research towards next-generation  micromotor technology.

Abstract:   A granular system of particles undergoing  dissipative collisions  show inhomogeneous density clustering under many  circumstances.  We focus on two types of problems: (i) the system is  perturbed locally in space   and (ii) the full system is globally  perturbed initially and then left to cool freely.   Scaling theories  based on conservation laws  and event driven molecular dynamics  simulations of hard spheres  provide two theoretical tools to study such  systems.  The scaling exponents of various statistical quantities  evolving with time (e.g. the system energy)  are independent of the  value of the restitution co-efficient of the particles  and are thus  universal. Comparison is made with experimental data  wherever  available  to confirm the theoretical predictions. Bio: Prof. Dibyendu Das received his Bachelors in Physics from IIT  Kanpur.

No. 118  Ground floor  Chemical Engg. Dept.  (Attendance compulsory for CL702 students) Abstract: CO2 is a greenhouse gas that is partly responsible for global warming. Therefore it is desirable to seek ways to capture and convert CO2 into fuels that can be used to meet energy needs. Reduction of CO2 using solar energy via the photocatalytic process is an area that is attracting a lot of attention by researchers. TiO2 has been found to be photo active for CO2 reduction. However  the yields are low and due to its high bandgap  only the UV portion of the solar spectrum is utilized in the conversion process. One approach to overcome these limitations is to enhance the activity using co-catalysts. In addition  Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) has been suggested as a way to enhance activity. I will present some results from our lab on both these approaches. Another approach that is now attracting attention is the synthesis of Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) that have photo-active linkers and catalytic nodes. I will present some results of CO2 photoreduction studies based on this novel photocatalyst that was synthesized in our Chemistry department. In the second half of this talk  I will present some insights into the CO2 photo reduction reaction mechanism using electronic structure calculations based on Density Functional Theory (DFT). It is shown that the CO2 adsorbs in bent form on the catalyst surface and smaller the bond angle  the weaker the C-O bond strength. The presence of co-catalysts leads to enhanced bond-breaking. Oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface also make it easier to break the CO2 molecule. Brief profile of the speaker: Dr. Joseph graduated from IIT/Kanpur with B. Tech (Silver Medalist) in ChE and obtained his MS and Ph.D. in ChE from Case Western Reserve University. He then joined the Energy Lab at MIT where he worked on the development of ASPEN Simulator.  He joined the faculty of Chemical Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis in 1978 where he became the Edward C. Dicke Professor in 2000.

No. 118  Ground floor  Chemical Engg. Dept. Abstract: Crystal Nucleation is the primary mechanism for phase transformation from fluid to solid phases. Despite its widespread occurrence  our understanding of the mechanisms of nucleation is far from complete. In this talk  I will be discussing methods to study crystal nucleation using molecular simulations and the application of these techniques to system of binary hard spheres. Hard sphere represent the computationally easiest system that shows fluid-solid phase transition and the phase diagrams of binary hard sphere mixtures can show complex features such as azeotrope formation  eutectic points  co-crystal formation  etc. Through our simulations I will show that how the underlying phase diagram strongly influences the mechanism and pathway for crystal nucleation.

Date & Time: Wednesday  Nov 23 at 4pm. Abstract: Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is a multivariate data  analysis technique which was first introduced by Pearson in 1901   although the nomenclature was provided by Hotelling in 1933.  This  technique has gained significant popularity in recent years due to the  tremendous explosion in the volume of data that is being generated.   It  is mainly used as a data compression technique  which can aid in better  visualization and help reduce storage.  Since its humble beginnings as a  three letter acronym  it has evolved by acquiring another alphabet  (FPCA  DPCA   PPCA  SPCA  CPCA  IPCA  KPCA) or two (MLPCA  SWPCA).  Its  extended family includes recent members such as independent components  analysis (ICA) and network component analysis (NCA).  Other members of  this family (which do not bear the same family name) include  non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and factor analysis (FA).  This  talk will provide a taxonomy of all these methods using a measurement  error modelling framework.  The basic assumptions of this model for  deriving PCA will be elucidated and all other variants will be derived  by modifying the assumptions regarding either (a) the noise corrupting  the measurements (b) the model structure relating the different  variables or (c) the model structure that relates the different samples.  It is hoped that this taxonomy will provide a better theoretical  understanding of the different methods resulting in their proper use in  data analysis.  Scope for adding new meaningful acronyms to this  alphabet soup will also be pointed out. Bio: Shankar Narasimhan is currently the M.S.

Dept. Date & Time: Monday  Nov 28 at 4pm.  Abstract: The discovery and design of catalysts necessitate an  understanding of reaction chemistry at the molecular level. In recent  years  in silico chemistry has made significant strides in the  large-scale screening of catalyst materials. In particular  density  functional theory (DFT)  owing to its simplicity and low cost  has been  instrumental in making quantum chemistry a viable field of study.  The  development of DFT involves approximations to the exchange-correlation  (XC) potential between interacting electrons. These parameters have been determined based on either satisfaction of certain exact constraints or  by fitting the functional to benchmark databases. I will discuss the  development and performance of the Bayesian Error Estimation Functional  (BEEF)  which employs principles of machine learning to systematically  determine the optimal compromise between XC model complexity and  accuracy. We are also examining the space of available dispersion-correction schemes within  the BEEF framework in order to accurately predict adsorption energies  and barrier heights on transition metal surfaces.  In addition to  accurate quantum chemical methods  there is also a need for  computationally efficient and automated means to determine transition  states (TS) of reactions. TS search requires information about the  reaction coordinate  which typically involves calculation of expensive  second derivatives of the electronic energy (hessian). We have developed  a computationally efficient  gradient-based finite differences Davidson  method as an alternative to full hessian calculation. This approach can  significantly lower costs associated with the search and characterization of TS’s  especially when systems are  large  and hessians intractable. We have applied this approach to  examine the sensitivity of reaction rates of light alkanes to the size  and shape of the nanopores containing active sites in zeolite catalysts.

No. 240  Chemical Engg. Dept. Date & Time: Tuesday  Nov 29 at 3:30pm. Abstract: Our mission is to address grand challenges in particle  science and technology. These are related to the formation  processing  and application of particulate systems along the five dimensions of  size  shape  surface  structure and composition. Today  unit operations  and product design are the two most important pillars of chemical  engineering. The applications define the required product properties  which cover both classical fields of process technology in the chemical  industry as well as new emerging fields of electronics  energy and  environmental technologies  life sciences  materials science and  engineering  nanotechnology  and photonic technologies. Unifying principles of particulate product design are proposed which  are widely applicable to many different kinds of products including  solid  liquid  and even gaseous particles. Results from the Erlangen  Cluster of Excellence “Engineering of Advanced Materials” show that the  joint venture of chemical engineering with materials science in concert  with the basic sciences opens new prospects for all involved  disciplines. Today  particle technology moves forward from careful control of “only”  particle size to systems with higher complexity  i.e. shape  surface   structure and composition  both on the level of single particles and  particle ensembles. We highlight aspects of these trends by focusing on  synthesis and characterization of quantum dots into well-defined  structures of rods  ellipsoids  mesocrystals  porous spheres and thin  films  all with interesting functional properties. Analytical  ultracentrifugation equipped with a multiwavelength UV/Vis detector can  be used to analyze particle systems with unprecedented accuracy and  resolution. Examples will be given for “green” carbon nanodots and sizes  below 1 nm  shape analysis for graphene obtained through a scalable  delamination process and analysis of size-dependent optical properties.  Finally  optimization techniques are presented for particle formation in  liquids (quantum dot systems) and nanoparticles in the gas phase (Si  nanoparticles).

No. 240  Chemical Engg. Dept. Date & Time: Monday  Nov 28 at 11am. Abstract: Catalytic conversion of biomass to value-added chemicals  provides renewable alternatives to a wide range of products of interest  in our everyday life  ranging from monomers  bio-compatible plastics to  environmentally friendly detergent cleaners. These conversion processes  often involve complex multistep reactions such as  hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis  oxidation  dehydrogenation  dehydration   condensation and amination. The challenge is to develop active   selective and stable catalysts to meet the economic and environmental  compatibility. This lecture will present an overview of recent  development in biomass conversion technologies with specific reference  to hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) and oxidation of sugars and polyols.  Distinguishing features of biomass feedstocks and their conversion  processes are: (a) they are oxygen rich in contrast to petroleum  feedstocks consisting of hydrocarbons  (b) thermally unstable at higher  temperatures demanding liquid phase processing and (c) overall  selectivity depends on competing reactions requiring control of C-O   C-C  C-H and C-N bond cleavage/coupling reactions. The catalysts used   reaction pathways and kinetic modeling will be discussed with specific  examples on (a) HDO of polyols to glycols and value added products and  (b) oxidation of sugars and polyols to mono and dicarboxylic acids.  While HDO is a known example of an alternative route for 1 2  propanediol  the selectivity varies with catalyst  supports and reaction  conditions. Major disadvantage is the large consumption of expensive  hydrogen and significant yield loss in eoxygenation. In this context  a  new concept of tandem dehydrogenation/reforming coupled with HDO to  achieve high selectivity of value added products will be discussed. In  contrast to HDO  oxidation of sugars and polyols to carboxylic acid  derivatives has the advantage that the rich oxygen value in the  feedstocks is retained. The role of novel bimetallic catalysts for  activity and selectivity improvement will be discussed along with  detailed surface characterization and kinetic studies. Particularly  the  role of bimetallic alloys and defect structures in tuning catalytic  performance will be discussed. Bio: Dr. Raghunath V. Chaudhari is the Dean E.

Date & Time: Thursday  Jan 5 2017 at 5pm  Abstract:  The flow of droplets in confined channels is common in a  variety of applications including polymer and emulsion processing as  well as oil  recovery  from porous materials.   More recently  droplets   in microfluidic devices have evolved as a means  to conduct chemical  reactions in small controlled volumes that can be manipulated easily.   In the first part of my talk  I will present results for the steady flow  of droplets in straight cylindrical channels  and their transient  response to a sudden expansion in the channel diameter.  I will consider  the effects of inertia as well as the presence of surfactants on the  drop dynamics.  Increasing the  Reynolds  number  is  seen  to  cause   non-monotonic  trends  in  the  drop  deformation  velocity  and extra  pressure loss across the channel.  Parameters such as the drop viscosity  and presence of surfactants were seen to have smaller effects when the  Reynolds number became  large. The  transient deformation of drops  moving  through expansions depended strongly on  the  shape of  the drop  upstream of  the expansion.   The  inclusion of  inertial effects caused  increases  in  the  transient deformation as well as oscillations as   the drops relaxed back into their steady shape.  In the second part of  the talk  I will discuss some of our experimental results on the  interphase synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles in droplets in a  channel.  Conducting  the synthesis  reaction  inside droplets of  controlled size offers several advantages such as eliminating  temperature and concentration gradients inside the reactor  as  well  as  preventing  reactor  fouling.    The  technique  produces  zinc  oxide  nanoparticles  with  a  narrow  particle  size  distribution  as   compared  to  a  batch  reactor.  Spherical as well as plate-like shapes  of zinc-oxide nanoparticles are seen for the ranges of parameters  studied.  The size and morphology of the nanoparticles is shown to be  easily controlled by varying reagent concentrations  reaction  temperature  and residence time.

No. 118  Ground floor  Chemical Engg. Dept. Date & Time: Monday  Jan 16 at 5pm Abstract: Global warming and energy shortage raise the concern about greenhouse  gases and renewable energy. One of the best routes to covert CO2 into  renewable energy and simultaneously reduce the concentration of CO2 in  atmosphere is photosynthesis[1]. This study explored the photocatalytic  hydrogenation of CO2 by a novel twin reactor to mimic photosynthesis  process under light irradiation. The Z-scheme of water splitting is comprised of H2-photocatalyst and  O2-photocatalyst with aid of electron transfer mediator to produce  hydrogen and oxygen  respectively [2]. A novel twin reactor  which  divided H2-photocatalyst and O2-photocatalyst in two compartments using  a membrane  can separate H2 and O2 thus preventing backward reaction.  Pt/SrTiO3:Rh and BiVO4 were used as the H2-photocatalyst and the  O2-photocatalyst  respectively. The diffusion of electron mediator   Fe2+/Fe3+  through Nafion membrane was investigated. The transfer rate  of mediator ions was remarkably higher than the photoreaction rate   indicating that membrane did not delay the water-splitting reaction in  the twin reactor[3]. The CO2 hydrogenation was carried out in the H2 side of the twin  reactor. Photocatalytic reaction was performed under AM 1.5G sunlight.  Oxygen can be released from the O2 side of the twin reactor.  Simultaneously H+ was diffused through the membrane to the H2 side. CO2  was purged in the H2 side then reduced to hydrocarbons by photocatalyst  [4]. A series of sol-gel prepared InTaO4 were loaded with different metal  oxide such as NiO  RuO2  Cu(OH)2 and Pt were as co-catalysts. The UV-VIS  spectra of this series catalysts indicated that the photocatalysts could  absorb visible light. These CO2 hydrogenation catalysts were applied  into the twin photoreactor. In aqueous system  which catalyst was  dispersed in the solution  the maximum yields of methanol and  acetaldehyde were 9.27 μmole/g•hr and 11.30 μmole/g•hr at 25oC. The twin  photoreactor gave higher yields of CO2 than those in the single reactor  because the backward (oxidation) reaction was inhibited by separating O2  in the other side [5]. References: [1] N.

No. 118  Ground floor  Chemical Engg. Dept. Date & Time: Thursday  Jan 19 at 5pm (Room 118) Abstract:  Neural stem cells (NSC’s) often give rise to mixed  population of cells during differentiation. However  the dynamical  origin of these mixed states is poorly understood. In this article  our  mathematical modeling study demonstrates that the bone morphogenetic  protein 2 (BMP2) driven differential differentiation dynamics of NSC’s  in central and peripheral nervous systems essentially function through  two distinct bi-stable switches that are mutually interconnected.  Stochastic simulations of the model reveal that the mixed population  originates due to the existence of these bi-stable switching regulations  while the maintenance of such mixed states depends on the level of  stochastic fluctuations of the system. Importantly  the model predicts  that by individually altering the expression level of key regulatory  proteins  the NSC’s can be converted entirely to a preferred phenotype  for BMP2 doses that earlier resulted into mixed population. Our findings  show that efficient neuronal regeneration can be achieved by  systematically maneuvering the differentiation dynamics.

No. 240  Chemical Engg. Dept. Abstract:  At the transition to the nanoscale  interfacial and  finite-size effects become significant which are often neglected in  phenomenological models. The properties and the dynamics of dispersed  phases  contact lines  and nanostructured systems are hard to capture  experimentally due to the high resolution which is required and the short time scale on which  phase transitions and fluctuations may occur. Therefore  in the present  work  massively-parallel molecular dynamics simulation with the scalable  code ls1 mardyn [1] is applied to wetting phenomena. For sessile droplets on a perfectly planar solid substrate  the  dependence of the contact angle on the magnitude of the dispersive  fluid-substrate interaction and the temperature is characterized for  Lennard-Jones model systems [2  3]. On this basis  contact line pinning  is discussed for heterogeneously patterned surfaces in the impregnation  wetting regime  and for the epitaxial Cassie state  where a contact line  of an advancing droplet is stuck at an edge. In this way  the influence  of the surface morphology on the contact angle and the contact line is  captured with molecular resolution. The perspective for multiscale  modelling and simulation approaches is discussed [4]  and it is shown  how molecular simulation results can complement experimental data on the  surface morphology of alkylsilane self-assembled monolayers on a silica  substrate [5].

Venue: Room. No. 118  Ground floor  Chemical Engg. Dept. Abstract: Ionomers are polymers with a small fraction of charged  monomers; these bound ions  along with free counterions  tend to  aggregate together strongly in the absence of solvent. They have a wide  range of applications from dental fixtures and packaging to fuel cell  mebranes. Ionic aggregates can act like temporary cross-links  giving  rise to interesting mechanical properties. I perform coarse-grained  molecular dynamics simulations of ionomer melts with various spacings of  charges along the chain  representing experimental precisely spaced   neutralized poly(ethylene-co-acrylic acid) materials. I study these  systems during uniaxial tensile strain and calculate aggregate  morphology  dynamics and scattering profiles. Prior work established a  useful coarse-grained model for fully neutralized acetic acid based  ionomers  which include COO – and Na + but no COOH groups. To better  model typical experimental systems that are only partially neutralized   I use additional “sticker” groups that represent COOH. Aggregate  morphologies obtained using the sticker-based model are in good  agreement with prior atomistic simulation results. I analyze the  structure and dynamics of partially neutralized ionomers with differing  chain architectures  as well as rheological properties like viscosity  and stress relaxation from equilibrium stress fluctuations.

Abstract:  Biological tissues are comprised of functionally specialized  cell types that are organized in complex circuits. To understand the  workings of complex tissues  such as the brain or the intestine  we  need  at the very least  a catalog of the cell types that comprise them  (i.e. the ""parts list""). This is a cornerstone of biology. Cell types  have been defined based on shape  anatomical position  physiological  response and  more recently  using molecular and genetic markers. I will describe our recent work using a new technology that enables  large-scale measurements of gene expression in single-cells to address  this challenge in an unbiased  systematic and data-driven manner. Using  novel computational approaches to analyze the massive data that results  from these measurements  we have both defined cell types in the mouse  retina  and validated them biologically using rigorous histological  techniques. This has also led to the discovery of new cell types in the  mouse retina. Using this molecular census as a foundation  we are now  exploring ways to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the  development and maintenance of this diversity  and its functional  implications in neurodegenerative disease.

Engg. dept  Abstract: CO hydrogenation is one of the technologies used for converting gaseous fuels such as methane to easily transportable  high energy density liquid fuels. The technology was developed during second world war by chemists Fischer and Tropsch for converting coal derived syngas ( mixture of CO and H2) to synthetic crude oil. The technology is currently commercial in South Africa.  GTL (Gas to Liquid) technology is also used to convert abundant natural gas to liquid fuels in countries like Qatar  Malayasia and Nigeria. Recently this technology is being applied to produce renewable liquid fuels from biomass. Iron and cobalt are two of the commonly used metal catalysts for FTS. In this talk  I will present some recent results on the synthesis  characterization and evaluation of cobalt based catalysts for CO hydrogenation. I will present justification for using an egg-shell morphology to control the product distribution. I will also present some results of experimental studies on CO hydrogenation using egg-shell cobalt catalysts. In the second part of the talk  I will present some insights into the FTS reaction mechanisms using electronic structure calculations based on Density Functional Theory (DFT).

Venue: Room. No. 240  Chemical Engg. Dept.  Abstract:  Organic/metal organic compounds that mimic the functional  role of enzymes have been extensively investigated. Recently  few  nanomaterials such as gold nanoparticles  ferromagnetic nanoparticles  and graphene-based materials have been innovatively shown to exhibit  unprecedented biochemical catalysis by mimicking certain enzymes  (nanozymes). Owing to their simplicity of preparation and storage and  stability  nanozymes have been investigated for their application in  many fields such as biosensing  immunoassays  cancer diagnostic   therapeutic and pollutant removal  etc. Despite current interest on  nanozymes  tackling with some of the difficulties associated with them  such as selectivity  cooperativity with other enzymes  limited surface  area due to functionalization  biocompatibility and activity in cells   etc. is a challenging task. In this seminar  I will discuss about the novel antioxidant and  phosophotriesterase nanozymes. We have recently reported the  graphene-hemin hybrid material for its remarkable peroxynitrite  reductase and isomerase antioxidant activities. Noncovalent interactions  of hemin and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) resulted in synergistic  activity to effectively scavenge peroxynitrite  which is a potent  reactive nitrogen species (RNS) found in vivo. In another related study  we found that vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) bears  an unexpected antioxidant role in its nano-form and shows tremendous  cytoprotective effects. The vanadia nanozyme exhibit excellent  glutathione peroxidase (GPx)-like antioxidant activity and prevents  oxidative damage to cells from reactive oxygen species (ROS). This work  demonstrates the first experimental evidence that the biological  property of a metal ion in its nano-form can be completely different  from that of a bulk material. In a similar line  I will also briefly  highlight the engineered oxidase and phosphotriesterase nanozymes for  antibody-free detection of major biomarkers of oxidative stress and  degradation of sarin-related nerve agents  respectively. In the second part of the presentation  I will highlight engineered  viruses for drug delivery applications. Viruses are protein structures  with RNA that have simple structure but tremendous efficacy in host cell  transfection. Although they can serve as drug delivery agents  their  immunogenic properties can cause severe side-effects. However  plant  viruses are non-pathogenic to humans and have large potential for such  applications. Along this line  I will discuss about the kinetics and  molecular interactions that help in stabilizing platinum-based  anticancer agents in the channel of the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) to  result in an engineered capsule-like drug delivery construct.

Engg. dept  Abstract:  Messenger RNA 3’ end formation – the process by which the primary transcript is cleaved and polyadenylated – is a near-universal feature of gene expression in eukaryotes.  The relative position at which the precursor mRNA is cleaved and polyadenylated determines the ultimate protein-coding potential of the mRNA as well as other functional aspects of the mRNA.  Most eukaryotic pre-mRNAs have more than one potential poly(A) site  and the choice of site often can vary during development or in response to environmental stimuli.  In most cases  however  the means by which sensory cues are linked with poly(A) site choice are not known.  In plants  one such connection involves a core subunit of the polyadenylation complex  CPSF30.  CPSF30 is a small RNA binding protein whose activities are regulated in vitro by calmodulin and by reagents that modify disulfide linkages in proteins.  In the plant  CPSF30 plays roles in numerous processes  including root growth and responses to oxidative stress. Interestingly  calmodulin-mediated regulation is important for the functioning of CPSF30 in root growth but not responses to oxidative stress.  Our studies indicate that CPSF30 is a multifaceted transducer of signaling cues  and that it links different pathways with alternative polyadenylation  growth  and development.

Date & Time: Thursday  2-nd March at 5 PM Venue: Room. No. 118  Ground floor  Chemical Engg. Dept.  Abstract: The ability to mechanically-sense solid surfaces is important for motile bacteria to initiate swarming – a rapid surface-dependent group-motility associated with infections. Such mechanical sensing (mechanosensing) involves the bacterial flagella but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. I will discuss our recent work that combined single-molecule imaging  fluorescencerecovery-after-photobleaching and optical tweezers to determine how single flagellar motors (that rotate the flagellum) sense mechanical signals in live cells. I will explain how the motor regulates its assemblies in response to mechanical stimulus with a simple model that incorporates a catch-bond mechanism. Additionally  a molecular switch within the motor that is responsible for changes in the direction of rotation also responds to mechanical stimuli by adapting its activity. The amount of torque generated by the motor depends on the switch – torque is higher in the CCW direction and lower in the CW direction. Yet  cells that carry a single  rigid flagellum swim with similar speeds in the forward and backward directions. The resulting paradox that emerges due to the time-reversibility of Stokes flow can be resolved with a simple model that incorporates cell-precession during swimming. I will conclude with a brief note on the relevance of these findings to our current understanding of the influence of mechanical forces on signaling and the evolutionarily-conserved motor-mechanics.

Buttrey's Talk","Start: 6 Mar 2017 - 11:30 End: 6 Mar 2017 - 12:30 Abstract: Selective oxidation catalysis is used in production of roughly 25% of all important organic chemicals and intermediates used for making consumer and industrial products [1]. The abundance of natural gas from shale resources makes efficient catalytic oxidation of light hydrocarbons to more valuable intermediates particularly desirable. Complex mixed metal oxides (MMO) based on molybdenum-vanadium oxide bronzes offer particular promise for C2 and C3 conversions. Mo-V-O bronzes are both active and selective for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane to ethylene. Since high temperature thermal conversion of ethane to ethylene is one of the most energy consuming chemical processes employed today  replacement of this process by catalytic ODH is highly desirable. More complex Mo-V-Nb- (Te Sb)-O variants show promise for selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid and ammoxidation to acrylonitrile. Several different periodic structures exist in these multimetallic suboxide systems  and sometimes these can form intergrowth structures  complicating the preparation. In the case of propane (amm)oxidation  the most effective catalyst seems to require a blend of two crystalline forms  commonly known as M1 and M2. These catalysts may replace existing technology involving multicomponent bismuth molybdate catalysts that require more costly propylene as the feed. Careful structural and compositional characterization of these newer catalytic MMO bronze materials is needed to quantitatively assess phase content. Evaluation of mixed site occupancies and mixed valences from combining Rietveld analysis of diffraction data with direct space studies provides insights into catalytic mechanisms [2]. Recent studies indicating unusual lattice dynamics in the active site at elevated temperatures suggest that dynamics may also play an important mechanistic role [3]. Challenges remain that impede commercialization  particularly with issues of scale up and with control of crystallite size and habit. Observation of the self-assembly process during crystallization [4] suggests that there are some parallels with the growth of zeolites in that they do not exhibit simple nucleation and growth. The M1 phase and some other related forms initially require formation of M6O21 pentagonal subunits that connect with linking octahedra to form periodic frameworks with nanochannels [5]. These nanochannels permit intercalation of species that can modify valence states in the framework and can participate in the catalysis.

Engg. dept  Abstract: Unmixed Combustion (UMC)  a novel variant of combustion  occurs when air and fuel alternately pass over an Oxygen Storage and Release Material (OSRM)  mainly metal/metal oxides which undergo oxidation and reduction reactions. In this study  the potential of UMC is demonstrated for heat transfer applications. A purpose-built test rig  based on a dynamically operated Packed Bed Reactor (PBR) concept was designed  fabricated and commissioned. Experiments were conducted using a representative Cu based OSRM along with methane (CH4) and zero air (21 mol% O2) as reactive gases. The energy generated in both oxidation and reduction due to exothermicity was radially transferred by conduction and convection to coolant air. For a specific loading of 1.25 kg of OSRM and fixed reaction cycle times  the effect of varying zero air  coolant and CH4 flowrate and reactive gas inlet temperature on the radial heat transfer was investigated. The radial heat transfer rate was maximized at 95 ± 2 % of total energy in the bed at an inlet temperature of 873.15 K and zero air  coolant and CH4 flowrates of 15 LPM  150 LPM and 2 LPM (corresponding to 10 mol % concentration) respectively. Under “cyclic” steady state conditions  the variation of bed temperature and coolant outlet temperature was restricted to within ± 30 K and ± 3 K respectively and the combustion process was observed to be self-sustaining. In addition a separate experimental investigation related to estimating kinetic parameters of oxidation of Cu and reduction of CuO  encountered in UMC  was carried out using a Pulsed Micro-reactor (PMR) technique. A simple generic methodology  based on a uniform reaction model was adopted and has been validated for both reactions which were found to be surface reaction controlled. The estimated values of reaction orders and activation energies for both reactions and the pre-exponential factor for oxidation were found to be in good agreement with those obtained using Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA). A lower value of pre-exponential factor for reduction however was obtained. The PMR approach offers a simple and effective alternative to quantitatively identify non-catalytic gas–solid reaction kinetics. A dynamic  2-D pseudo-homogeneous model for UMC based PBR  integrated with heat transfer to a coolant has also been developed. A commercial software COMSOLTM was used for model implementation. The model predicts the axial and radial temperature profiles in the bed and total heat transfer for prescribed operating conditions used in the experimental runs. The model results obtained for one cycle comprising of oxidation and reduction were compared with experimental data and good agreement to within ± 9 % was obtained in all cases. No adjustment factors were incorporated in the model. The study also validates the use of a pseudo-homogeneous model in predicting the behaviour of dynamically operated UMC systems under relatively mild conditions. The results obtained present a strong argument for using UMC based reactor systems as an alternative to “premixed” combustion for process heat transfer applications subject to suitable combination of operating conditions inclusive of cycle time  reactor material of construction and choice of OSRM.

While the importance of bio-chemical signals is known and under investigation for long  only in last decade we have started to appreciate the roles of physical/mechanical signals in determining cells' function and fate. Mechanical signals  such as substrate modulus  substrate topology  shear stress  stretching  vibration etc have been shown to influence cell survival  cell spreading  cell division  migration and differentiation. Mechano-signals and their transduction into biological signals are important to maintain our healthy life. In many diseased conditions cancer  tissue rigidity and cellular ability to sense the mechanical properties of the surroundings have been reported to get altered. In this talk  I will present the overview of cell mechanics and a glimpse of different research projects from our laboratory. In particular  I will discuss our ongoing work on cellular patterning using sub-surface microstructures. We have demonstrated that a rigid sphere embedded in a soft substrate influences cellular migration at the surface of the substrate resulting into formation of long-range patterns. This process is majorly governed by physical parameters such as substrate rigidity and thickness  and independent of the type of extra-cellular matrix or cell types.

Dept. *Abstract* Neurological disorders are a group of incurable  chronic disorders of  central nervous (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems. Several extensive  studies reported that an atypical protein kinase C  PKMzeta plays a  crucial role in neurodegenerative disorder such as Alzheimer’s   maintenance of long term potentiation  cognition  neuropathic pain and  cancer. Drug discovery efforts have been hindered due to the  non-availability of the protein structure. Hence in the present study   an attempt was made to classify and build open and closed models of the  protein PKMzeta using comparative modeling and molecular dynamics  approaches. The refined models were used to identify PKMzeta inhibitors  utilizing a high-throughput virtual screening protocol from large  commercial chemical and in-house databases. The selected hit compounds  were subjected to in vitro luminescent based kinase assay and in vivo  screening for their inhibitory activity on the target protein. The lead  showed analgesic  anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. The  results revealed the importance of PKMzeta inhibitions with  neuro-therapeutic implications. Further  an attempt was made to study the associations between  drugs and diseases. Diseases from broad coverage of therapeutic areas  were taken along with their FDA approved drugs  with their respective  gene signatures obtained from literature mining. Gene enrichment  analysis was performed against set of genes (either from drugs/disease)  using the R-package HTSanalyzeR. The most significant associations were  visualized.

No. 118  Ground floor  Chemical Engg. Dept.  Abstract:  Many instances involving fluid flow around arbitrary shaped  particles with small surface features at finite Reynolds number can be  found in both nature and technological applications. In this talk  an  efficient hybrid approach combining Finite-Difference (FD) method and  Boundary Integral (BI) method is presented. The 2D unsteady Stokes  equation is solved on a Cartesian grid using a second order FD  method while the 2D steady Stokes equation is being solved near the  particle using BI method. The two methods are coupled within the viscous  boundary layer  a few FD grid cells away from the particle  where  solutions from both FD and BI methods are valid. We demonstrate that  this hybrid method can be used to accurately solve for the flow around  particles with irregular shapes  even though radius of curvature of the  particle surface is not resolved by the FD grid. This method allows us  to formulate an O(N) scheme for dilute suspensions  where N is the  number of particles. For semi-dilute suspensions  where particles may cluster  a novel envelope  formation method has been formulated and implemented  which enables  solving the BI problem for each individual particle cluster  allowing  efficient simulation of hydrodynamic interaction between particles even  when they are in close proximity. We will also discuss how  below a  threshold particle Reynolds number  which in turn depends on the  required resolution of the particle surface  the FD-BI scheme will be more computationally  efficient than a pure FD scheme solved on a multi-block grid.

Date & Time: Thursday  6-th April  at 5:00 PM Venue: Room. No. 118  Ground floor  Chemical Engg. Dept.  Abstract: The conflict between environmental sustainability and human safety versus industrial development is an elemental one for an emergent economy like India. Several national codes and regulations exist presently for controlling spatial separation between hazardous industrial facilities and neighboring developments. Despite this  a number of challenges remain to be addressed  which  inter alia  include: burgeoning demographic pressure  lack of consolidated governmental policy on Land Use Planning (LUP)  absence of objective industrial risk tolerability criteria  and diversity within the states in terms of development levels and land use patterns. Absence of an integrated solution to these challenges has led to gradual creation of high societal risk areas over the last few decades  especially contiguous to process industry hubs. While technological risk assessment can provide a point of beginning  the practicable solutions to LUP in the vicinity of process industries need to take cognizance of the socio-economic predilections of the stakeholders  i.e.  the landowner  the general populace  the industry and the government. This presentation attempts to highlight how risk assessment for process industries can be effectively integrated with LUP policies to mitigate the effects of major accident hazards posed by fixed process installations while keeping in mind the industrial development priorities of the country. In particular  the potential economic conflict between private and societal interests is assessed through a CostBenefit Analysis for evolving possible solutions towards socially acceptable mode of risk management. Further  a mathematical model based on the well-known economic indicator  Life Quality Index (LQI)  is proposed in way of suggesting a possible approach to conflating industry and government strategies on public risk management. The need for accommodating the underpinning ethical imperatives  grounded in Indian and Western philosophical traditions  is also highlighted.

Engg.dept (Compulsory for CL702 and CL704 students) Abstract: Online implementation of various tasks such as model based optimal control  state estimation  etc. involves repeated solving of optimization problems with same structure but with different parameter values. In recent literature  multiparametric programming has emerged as a popular option for facilitating online optimization of such tasks for fast dynamical systems. Multiparametric programming divides the parameter space into the so-called critical regions and pre-computes optimal solutions offline as a function of the parameters for these critical regions. The online step thus involves determination of the critical region in which the current point(parameter) is located. However  for large number of critical regions  this point location problem can itself become computationally challenging. In this work  we propose a linear machine based novel approach for the point location problem. The approach  motivated from pattern classification literature  involves associating linear discriminant functions with the critical regions. The current point is then assigned to the critical region with the largest discriminant function value. We also establish a necessary condition for existence of linear machine and propose a modified procedure  involving systematic subdivision of the parametric space  when this condition is not satisfied. Analysis of complexity and storage requirements  along with computational experiments on a large sized example  indicate that linear machine can be an efficient tool for solving the point location problem.

Saxena Auditorium Abstract: Of the many building blocks of nanotechnology  nanoparticles are the oldest and the most versatile. Thousands of types of nanoparticles have been synthesized using a vast collection of recipes  based on green  benign  and not-so-benign chemicals  and then characterized for their attributes. The effort made to understand these recipes  even the ones in widespread use  is miniscule. Particle synthesis from their molecular precursors occurs when concentration of the precipitating species increases beyond their solubility limit  leading to formation of nuclei through homogeneous nucleation and their subsequent growth to form stable particles. This classical mechanism explains formation of monosized particles through a burst of nucleation. In this talk  Prof. Sanjeev Kumar will cover recently proposed new mechanisms of particle synthesis  some of which are developed in our group. These mechanisms are interesting in that they lead to synthesis of relatively monosized particles without a burst of nuclei formation or new ways of realizing a burst of nucleation. He will also discuss observations in the literature which suggest that there is plenty more that needs to be understood at the lowest level of particle synthesis---the birth of first seeds for particle growth. The mechanistic understanding obtained has helped in synthesis of more monosized particles. About the Speaker: Sanjeev Kumar is currently a professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at IISc Bangalore. He obtained his BE degree from University of Roorkee (IIT-Roorkee)  and ME and PhD from IISc Bangalore  all in Chemical Engineering. After spending a couple of years at Purdue University  USA as a post-doctoral fellow  he joined IISc Bangalore as a faculty in the Department of Chemical Engineering in 1996  and has been there since. Sanjeev’s research interests lie in applying continuum modeling techniques to unravel complex phenomena in the general area of colloids and interfaces  specifically nanoparticles  agitated dispersions  foams  emulsions and more recently flow batteries and super-capacitors. He has  over the years  made substantial contribution to the use of population balances as a powerful modeling and simulation tool.

Molecular dynamics provides a tool to understand the  extraction process better at molecular level and can also help in design  of a specific extractant for a given species.

These extractants form reverse micellar  aggregates along with mineral acid and water molecules in the  non-aqueous solutions. These self-aggregates are dispersed in the organic dodecane phase or  form well defined reverse micelles grown sufficient in size depending on  the acid concentration. At sufficiently high concentration of the acid   the formation of a third phase is also seen with TBP. MD simulations can  predict the extent of extraction of Cadmium  Neodymium  Strontium  Zinc  and Lead by TODGA and TBP into dodecane. The simulated values of diffusion coefficient and coordination numbers  of various species are in good agreement with the experimental values.

Engg. dept Abstract: Droplet microfluidics is a powerful technology for cell analysis. Nanoliter to picoliter sized droplets enable encapsulation of single cells and fluids in confined boundaries. The method has found use in gene expression analysis with RT-PCR  protein & antibody secretion  response to drugs  bio-molecular analysis  rare cell search etc. Several groups have designed microfluidics to immobilize droplets in arrays for monitoring various cellular and biochemical phenomena. Although these devices effectively arrest droplets in traps  individual droplet retrieval remains a challenge. All droplets have to be retrieved in bulk which results in loss of addressability of droplets of interest. At Shilps Sciences  we have developed an ‘open droplet’ microfluidic device which allows for on chip incubation / monitoring of droplets followed by individual droplet transfer for downstream applications. This device can be a useful tool for single cell assays and cell line engineering applications. Bio-sketch: Dr. Ashwin Lal  is the Founder-CEO of Shilps Sciences. He did his M.Sc.

Engg. dept   Abstract:  Absolute temperature and viscosity measurement and control  at microscale dimensions is very important for microrheological  measurements. Present off-line techniques cannot provide absolute values  and have very low spatial resolution. Power spectral density analyses of  optical tweezers have been used earlier for ‘on the fly’ calibration  from Brownian fluctuation of optically trapped bead in frequency domain.  However  such techniques are computationally intensive and only works  for Newtonian fluids where the trapping exists for a sufficiently long  time. On the other hand  we have developed a novel ‘on the fly’  calibration of optical tweezers that does not have any such restrictions  and can  in turn  provide control and measurement of absolute  temperature and viscosity at microscales. We apply such time domain  calibration methods to probe microscopic structural changes in complex  fluids. We present results that show microrheological aging dynamics of  laponite suspension using femtosecond optical tweezers. Bio: Debabrata Goswami (DG) works at the frontiers of interdisciplinary  research embodying theoretical and experimental developments in the  fundamental aspects of femtosecond laser-matter interactions. In past  two decades  DG has been independently carrying out research in his  self-made laboratories where he constructed several versions of tunable  and programmable femtosecond pulse shapers. DG utilizes Fourier Optics  and interferometers to circumvent ultrashort timescales in coherent  control  superresolution microscopy  etc. and he was the first to  propose how the phase of a laser pulse can be critical in Quantum  Computing. He was also the first to propose how thermal lens introduced  by high repetition rate femtosecond lasers lead to the additional  convection channel usage  resulting in molecular structure distinction.  DG developed self-calibrated femtosecond optical tweezers that can  directly detect colloidal assembly and their structure and orientation.  DG used this novel method of self-calibrated femtosecond optical  tweezers to provide a direct measure and control of 'in situ'  temperature and viscosity at microscale volumes. He has managed to show  how to distinguish between overlapping fluorophores in multi-photon  imaging microscopy by exploiting repeated excitation and de-excitation  processes with high repetitive rate femtosecond lasers. His research  contributions have resulted in over 125 peer-reviewed publications and  numerous conference proceedings.","webmaster","29 May 2017 - 07:52","29 May 2017 - 07:55","Seminar/Talk","Prof. Debabrata Goswami  Dept of Chemistry  IIT Kanpur","Microrheology of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids and  Suspensions using Femtosecond Optical Tweezers","Room No. 235  1-st floor  Chem.

No. 118  Ground floor  Chemical Engg. Dept. Abstract:  Gliomas are known to be highly heterogenous tumors  in their  both genetic content as well as tumor microenvironment. Active DNA  demetylation in the hypoxic interiors  mediated by TET proteins  appear  to contribute to the cellular complexity and genomic instability  associated with these difficult-to-treat and highly recurrent tumors. In  recent times  epigenetic regulators are being identified as drivers of  oncogenesis and are being considered as therapeutic targets. During my  Ph.D.  I studied TET1 and 3 as mediators of pluripotent induction in  hypoxic cells  thereby suggesting their therapeutic relevance in  effectively controlling the dedifferentiation of cancer cells in the  hypoxic core of gliomas. I would talk about the involvement of  epigenetic modifications mediated by TET in regulating master  transcription factors that maintain pluripotent in GBM hypoxia.

European monarchs of the time  cared about their ships surviving the rough Atlantic waves and thus  Euler  Lagrange  Newton  and many distinguished others worked on  nonlinear wave equations. In 1955  Fermi  Pasta  Ulam and Tsingou were  the first to examine the dynamics of a mass-spring chain where the  springs were weakly nonlinear and showed that the system had great  trouble equilibrating. In 1983  Nesterenko first examined impulse  propagation through an alignment of elastic grains  a strongly nonlinear  system  and showed these systems support the propagation of energy  packets that don’t disperse called solitons/solitary waves. Since then  we have learned that nonlinear systems can show unexpected clustering of  unusually large amounts of energy (rogue waves or fluctuations)  can be  used to disperse large shock waves or effectively transmit mechanical  energy and even harvest mechanical energy from noisy environments. It  may even be possible to use nonlinear pulses to perform stand-off  detection and imaging of shallow buried objects such as large and small  landmines. The talk shall focus on the basic physics of these systems  for a broader audience and highlight the multifaceted applications of  broad relevance.

The  present  effort  is  to   demonstrate  through  real  life  examples  the  following:  1.  Optimization  of equipment’s:  How  CFD  has  been  useful  in   providing  recommendations  to  increase  efficiency  of process   equipment’s  i.e.  Rotating  equipments   extraction  columns  and   fixed  bed  reactors. Improvement in efficiencies of rotating  equipment’s has improved energy savings during operations while   reduction  in  back-mixing  in  extraction  columns  has  reduced  the   height  of  the  columns. Similarly   improvement  in  flow  mal-distribution  recommendations  provide  stability  of  the  beds  in  fixed  bed  reactors.  2. Mathematical model  development:  (i)  For   mass  transfer  across  fluid-fluid interfaces which  helps  in   understanding  the  flow  patterns  inside  rising  droplets  for   gas-liquid  or liquid-liquid  systems.  (ii)  Modeling  of  droplet   coalescence  has  provided  new  insights  in understanding  fluid  bridge building and  internal circulations during droplet coalescence.   (iii) Model development  for  boiling outside  tubes  and  condensation   inside  tubes.  These models  have  helped providing  recommendations   to  reduce  stratification  in  safety  systems  (heat  exchangers)  for  advanced nuclear reactors 3. An example of integrating process modelling  and CFD is demonstrated. Integration  of  velocity  and  temperature   profiles  from  CFD  can  be  useful  in  modelling  the  bed behaviour  using Aspen Custom modeller. 4. A research plan to develop of cutting  edge technologies like micro-extractors  and  scale-up  for  separation   at  industrial  scale. This  involves design of micro-extractors    development  of mass  transfer models  to  understand  fluid  dynamics   (coalescence  and breakup)  and  mass  transport  in  micro-extractors    scale-up  and  scale-out  procedures  for  micro-extractors and flow  distribution when many units are integrated for commercial scale  seperations.

Date & Time: Thursday  August 3 at 5pm Venue: Room 118  Chemical Engg Dept Abstract: Two or more self-sustaining coupled non-linear oscillators  are able to synchronize their motion and maintain this state  indefinitely  even when their natural frequencies are slightly  different. This happens without the need of any external periodic force   which distinguishes this phenomena from resonance. We have been working  on an experimental setup and an associated mathematical model where two  tunable mechanical oscillators can be stabilized in either synchronized  or an anti-synchronized state by varying the system parameters. We modified the internal mechanism of the ""clockwork"" slightly  such  that the natural frequency and the internal damping could be  independently tuned.  A photodiode array based position detection system  driven by a microcontroller was devised to record the instantaneous  angular position of each oscillator.  This data was used to plot the  phase diagrams and extract the phase relation between the two  oscillators. I will discuss the results and  a mathematical model of non-linear  coupled oscillators within which the results can be understood - finally  I will discuss the potential significance of this problem.

No. 118  Ground floor  Chemical Engg. Dept. Abstract: Hydrogels are hydrophilic polymer networks  which can mimic  the physical and mechanical properties of the complex three-dimensional  (3D) microenvironment of cells and tissues in vivo. The nature of  polymer network that forms the hydrogel matrix greatly influences the  morphology and behavior of cells. We have developed free radical  mediated polymerized hydrogel systems and have blended them in varying  compositions to form hydrogel matrices with tuneable mechanical  properties. Cells encapsulated in an inert restrictive matrix show  spheroidal type of growth while those in a degradable matrix show  spreading and migration. This change in behavior of cells is observed  just by switching concentrations in a blended matrix system. We also saw  the effect of matrix on expression of epithelial to mesenchymal  transition (EMT) genes and found partial induction of EMT with time in  breast cancer cells when encapsulated in hydrogel matrices. The effect  of stiffness on sprouting angiogenesis was studied using chick aortic  arch assay and it was found that stiffer hydrogels did not promote as  much cell sprouting as softer gels. For furthering the in vivo  applications of these blended gels  we have also developed a porous  variant of this hydrogel system using cryogelation technique. While  being biocompatible and promoting cell adhesion  these matrices were  also found to be suitable as delivery vehicles for gene delivery  applications. The cryogels were loaded with lentiviruses and were shown  to effectively induce transduction of GFP gene when placed on HEK cell  monolayer. To summarize  we have developed a synthetic hydrogel  platform  which can further be improved for in vitro and in vivo  applications ranging from developing a drug screening platform  tissue  engineering and cellular programming via growth factor and gene delivery  for regenerative and immunotherapeutic purposes.

No. 118  Ground floor  Chemical Engg. Dept. Abstract: Bacterial DNA is assembled within the cell with the help of a  class of proteins called the Nucleoid Associated Proteins (NAPs). The  Histone-like Nucleoid Structuring Protein  or H-NS  has been shown to be  one of the major NAPs that assists in the silencing of potentially  virulent genes. While a lot of knowledge on H-NS has been obtained via  biochemical studies  the molecular mechanisms behind its gene silencing  function are not as well studied. Here  I shall present the results we obtained with our biophysical  study on the H-NS protein. To begin with  DNA sequence-dependent H-NS  binding was investigated. The 10 bp high-affinity H-NS nucleation site  of the proU gene was the primary sequence of interest. The experiments -  done using the magnetic tweezer - showed that H-NS has a particularly  strong affinity towards the nucleation sites in comparison to similarly  designed control sequences  in agreement with previous studies. In order  to gain a better understanding of the mechanism employed by H-NS in DNA  binding  the role of the H-NS linker that connects the C and N-terminal  was investigated. Point mutations on the linker resulted in a sharp  decrease in the binding affinity in comparison to wt H-NS  suggesting a  charge-dependent mechanism for DNA-binding. In our final study  H-NS-DNA  binding experiments were done with a longer DNA  where the two proU  nucleation sites were placed apart from one another. These experiments  revealed that H-NS initially prefers binding to the two nucleation sites  before undergoing local spreading along the DNA to completely cover it. Taken together  these results strengthen our understanding of H-NS-DNA  binding  and offer a potential mechanism by which H-NS carries out its  function of gene silencing.

Artificial membrane tubes are commonly pulled out from phospholipid vesicles using external force through laser tweezers or processive motor proteins. Recent examples have emerged where tubes spontaneously grow from vesicles coated with bioactive filaments in the presence ATP. We show how  topology of the vesicle surface  its local curvature and active forces due to the filaments  cause the soft vesicle to deform.

The information supporting many process and product  optimization comes from fundamental molecular simulation computations.  In this talk I will briefly discuss two different applications of  molecular modelling a) proton transport through perovskites  b)  computational investigation of novel lubricant-additives. Perovskites  are ceramics with general formula ABO3. High temperature proton  conducting properties of perovskites have also recently been used for  constructing membranes for cell reactors for catalytic  dehydrogenation/hydrogenation processes. It is known that perovskites  with more cubic structure have higher proton mobility. We have used  ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations (MD) to compute the diffusion  coefficients and the activation energies from trajectories obtained from  pure and Yttrium doped BaZrO3 at different concentrations and  temperatures. Thermodynamics of proton conductivity in these systems  were addressed by performing activation energy barrier calculations for  proton hopping transition states using Nudged Elastic Bands (NEB) theory  and ab-initio quantum chemical calculations. Finally  we have compared  the activation barriers from MD (dynamical energy barriers) with  thermodynamic barriers. Apart from this  we have analyzed the MD  trajectories for understanding proton conduction mechanism. In the second part  I will discuss about computational investigation of  novel lubricant-additives. In this study  we used nonequilibrium  molecular dynamics simulations to examine the friction and wear  reduction mechanisms of promising carbon nanoparticle friction modifier  additives-- carbon nanodiamonds (CNDs) and carbon nano-onions (CNOs).  Additives confined between iron slabs is probed at a range of coverages   pressures  and sliding velocities. The contribution to the friction  coefficient is well predicted by an expression developed for macroscopic  indentation by Bowden and Tabor.

However  when flow of viscoelastic polymer  solutions is considered  earlier experiments have observed all the three  possibilities due to addition of the polymer: no effect  a delay  or an  advancement in the Reynolds number for the onset of transition. We carry  out experiments to characterize the onset of transition in the flow of  polymer solutions in microtubes (of diameters 390 and 470 μm). Two  different polymer (polyacrylamide and polyethylene oxide) solutions at  varying concentrations are considered  and the transition is  characterized using micro-PIV measurements as well as dye-stream  visualization. By considering tubes of such small diameters  the present  experiments probe (hitherto unexplored) regimes of high elasticity  number E = λν/R 2 where λ is the longest relaxation time of the polymer  solution  ν is the kinematic viscosity and R is the tube radius. Our  results show that for small concentrations of the added polymer  there  is a transition delay  but at sufficiently large concentrations  the Re  for transition can be as low as 800. We show that the data for  transition Re for solutions of two different polymers of varying polymer  concentration  different tube diameters collapse well according to the  scaling relation Re c ∝ (E(1 − β)) −1/2   where β is the ratio of  solvent to solution viscosity. We also carry out linear stability  analyses for the pressure-driven flow of viscoelastic Oldroyd-B fluids  through rigid tubes and channels. This talk will discuss the results  from our theoretical analysis and their relevance to experimental  observations. Bio: V.

Various studies  claim that 80% to 85% of all accidents across domains ranging from  aviation  medicine  road transportation  nuclear power plants to  chemical process plants originate from human error. The systematic study  of human failures started in the 1970s post the Three Mile Island  nuclear plant accident  but has predominantly been restricted to a risk  assessment viewpoint  i.e.  developing estimates of human error rates   and incorporating human factors based interventions in the design stage. Our research is targeted at developing a science-based approach to  proactively detect human errors. Since ensuring safe operation requires  the active mental involvement of the operator  in our research  we  develop cognitive engineering based approaches for ensuring process  safety.  Cognitive science and engineering is a new interdisciplinary  field that studies the mind and its processes. In this talk  I will  provide a panoramic view of our research on the cognitive factors that  drive process operations. As an example  we will discuss patterns in the  eye gaze and pupil dilation of control room operators that seem to  foretell human error.

These nanoparticles are highly reactive and sensitive  to the changes in the vicinity of the particle surface and hence find  applications in the field of sensing of chemical and biological agents   catalysis  energy harvesting  data storage and many more. By  synthesizing bimetallic nanoparticles  a single nanoparticle can show  multifunctional characteristics. The focus of this presentation is to  detail the synthesis of bimetal nanoparticles of silver and cobalt  and  how these bimetallic nanoparticle systems show some fascinating and  interesting optical  chemical  and magnetic behaviors  some of which  fall into the category of symbiotic behavior. Symbiosis is the mutual  sharing of resources between two individual organisms. These bimetal  nanoparticles were synthesized using pulsed laser dewetting and  nanosphere lithography. After which  they were studied for their  oxidation stability  magneto-plasmonic effect  plasmon quality factor  and the radiative quantum efficiency. These results suggested that by  synthesizing symbiotic bimetal nanoparticles the properties of  individual metals could be significantly improved. The last part of the results will discuss how the symbiosis study of  bimetals led to the discovery of a new class of thin film amorphous  transparent semiconducting oxide. The semiconductor was made from a  ternary oxide comprising of the metals Fe  Tb  and Dy. The combination  of high visible light transparency  high conductivity  and  extraordinarily high mobility makes this material a potential candidate  for use in thin film transistor and transparent conductor applications  and is a possible replacement for Indium-based materials.

Engg. dept Abstract: Any talk by an oil & gas industry person must begin with the sustainability challenge and this presentation will be no different. The ‘energy transition’ from hydrocarbon to renewable is one of the greatest challenges to the human race. In this talk I will be sharing how Royal Dutch Shell  as an oil and gas major  is stepping up to this massive challenge at time when the business environment is far from buoyant. The need to deliver ‘more energy but less CO2’  whilst being very difficult   also generates a lot of scientific excitement and some of this excitement will be shared with the audience. As scientists and engineers the sustainability cause should be of relevance to the research ongoing at IITB whilst the effect of climate change should be of interest to any Indian citizen as we are one of the countries most at risk to climate change. The bulk of the presentation will focus on Shell bitumen products  where the research effort for this Downstream business is based entirely in Bangalore. The portfolio of projects range from characterising bitumen at a molecular or colloidal length scale (physical chemistry) to how these systems mix with additives (material science/polymer science) to the manufacture of the bitumen from crude oil (chemical engineering) and finally how the bitumen product is applied to aggregates to produce an asphalted road (civil engineering). The focus on asphaltenes  a group of molecules of critical importance to bitumen and crude oil  is an area of research which should generate particular interest as their structure and behavior remain unclear but might be unlocked if viewed through the fresh lens of IITB  experts. The talk will close with comments around the presence of Shell in India (its past and future) with particular emphasis on the new Technology Centre in Bangalore  one of the three Shell technology hubs.","webmaster","12 Dec 2017 - 08:13","12 Dec 2017 - 08:16","Seminar/Talk","Dr. Girish Rao Shell Bitumen R&D Manager Shell  Bangalore","Innovation from the Refinery to the Road","Room No. 240  first floor  Chem.

Brain  is the most protected and privileged organ  and crossing the BBB has  been a long-standing challenge in the treatment of brain disorders. We  are exploiting natural transport pathways available to serum  constituents for crossing the BBB. I will specifically discuss the  design and discovery of peptides that bind to one such protein   claudin-5  as a way of chaperoning drugs from the systemic circulation  into the brain. The second focuses on the use of a novel fabrication technique called  free form fabrication to build biological tissues from their constituent  cells and matrices. We have developed an on-demand 3D printing platform  to build a functional and viable vascularized human skin in a  layer-by-layer fashion. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that this  approach can reproduce many biological and morphological features of  human skin. I will present results on the use of printed human skin as  engineered grafts for regenerative medicine  and as efficacy models for  assessing inflammatory or immunological responses of topical agents on  skin.

First  different regimes of an air bubble in terms of  path instability and shape will be discussed. Then we will see how this  behaviour of an air bubble gets modified by the presence of another  bubble of the same size rising simultaneously. What happens when an air  bubble rises a viscosity stratified medium? The viscosity-stratification  can be achieved by the presence of concentration or temperature  gradients. Another fundamental question  are the dynamics of bubbles and  drops similar if we invert the gravity  will be discussed next.

Engg. dept Abstract: The specialty chemicals and pharmaceutical industry is conventionally (and almost entirely) based on the use of batch operations. Although batch or semi-batch processing offers some advantages because of the experience and familiarity  it has several disadvantages such as inconsistent performance (viz. product quality  yield  selectivity  etc.)  significantly lengthy operations  high utility consumption  large footprint  large inventory  unsteady operations and so on. The advent of continuous flow synthesis for small (gm/day) to medium scale (1 – 100 kg/day) operations is an important milestone in the processing of high value chemicals  intermediates  products and formulations. Small volume continuous flow reactors have been making foot-fall in the pilot and manufacturing scales over last decade. The batch to continuous transformation needs systematic approach. While it saves time for taking a product from lab to market  it demands certain scalability analysis that helps chemical engineers to understand the chemistry and chemists to keep some engineering principles in mind during its development. The approach that largely uses classical chemical reaction engineering for understanding (i) single step organic chemistry reactions  (ii) multistep flow synthesis  and (ii) synthesis of functional nanomaterials can be used for design of new reactor concepts for efficient production of valuable chemicals. While evolving and applying the approach  various interesting problems that arise from the coupling of reaction engineering with fluid dynamics for single phase and multiphase reactions. Here a few case studies will be presented along with important challenges that chemical engineers have to resolve for translating the laboratory scale synthesis (of intermediates for dyes  APIs  agrochemicals and nanomaterials for conducting inks and touch screen applications) to their continuous manufacturing.

No. 118  Ground floor  Chemical Engg. Dept.  Abstract: Mass cytometry (MC) is a recently developed single cell  analysis technique to identify several cellular biomarkers  simultaneously. This technique combines the power of flow cytometric  injection of cells with an inductively coupled mass spectrometer  (ICP-MS) coupled with time of flight detection. MC employs metal  isotopes to tag the antibodies (Abs) and these metal isotopes have a  unique mass that can be detected and quantified by mass spectrometry.  Flow cytometry  the most commonly used single cell analysis technique to  study cellular biomarkers can measure only up to 8 to 10 cellular  biomarkers simultaneously. Beyond the detection of 8 to 10 biomarkers   the technique is limited by the luminescence spectral overlap of the  dyes and the quantum dots used to tag the Abs which identifies the  specific biomarker on the surface or inside the cell. On the other hand   the number of biomarkers identified using MC depends only on the number  of different metal isotopes that can be used to tag the Abs. As with all  techniques  there is certain limitation to this technique as well. When  compared to flow cytometry  this technique suffers from poor sensitivity  due to the fact the current reagents  metal chelating polymers with 40  to 50 metal atoms per polymer chain  cannot generate enough signal to  identify proteins which are present in very low copy numbers in cells.  MC is a quantitative technique and the fact the signal intensity  increases linearly with the number of metal atoms tagged to each Ab  my  research is primarily involved in developing antibody conjugates with  more metal tags per Ab. To achieve this goal  I am working on developing  reagents based on nanoparticles to enhance the detection sensitivity of  low copy markers by one or two orders of magnitude than current  reagents. I will elucidate the various criteria which have to be  satisfied when employing NPs as high sensitive reagents. The synthesis   nucleation and growth kinetics of the various NPs will be discussed in  detail. Subsequently  I will talk about two surface modification process  to make the NPs biocompatible and their effect on the non-specific  interaction of the NPs with various cells lines. The various conjugation  chemistries to couple the NPs to Abs will be explored and finally finish  with examples of mass cytometry single cell measurements where the NPs  exhibit higher signal for various biomarkers when compared to current  metal chelating polymer reagents.

Engg. dept  Abstract: Human physiology is an ensemble of various biological processes spanning from intracellular molecular interactions to the whole body phenotypic response. Systems biology endures to decipher these multi-scale biological networks and bridge the link between genotype to phenotype. The structure and dynamic properties of these networks are responsible for controlling and deciding the phenotypic state of a cell. Several cells and various tissues coordinate together to generate an organ level response which further regulates the ultimate physiological state. The overall network embeds a hierarchical regulatory structure  which when unusually perturbed can lead to undesirable physiological state termed as disease. Here  we treat a disease diagnosis problem analogous to a fault diagnosis problem in engineering systems. Accordingly we review the application of engineering methodologies to address human diseases from systems biological perspective. The research work highlights potential networks and modeling approaches used for analyzing human diseases. The application of such analysis is illustrated in the case of diabetes and hypercholesterolemia. We put forth a concept of cell-to-human framework comprising of five modules (data mining  networking  modeling  experimental and validation) for addressing human physiology and diseases based on a paradigm of system level analysis. The work emphasizes on the importance of multi-scale biological networks and subsequent modeling and analysis for drug target identification and designing efficient therapies.

We demonstrate that hydrodynamic  interaction of a rod with a sphere in wall bounded shear flow can lead  to margination of sphere towards the wall. Effect of relative particle  concentration and shear rate on the microstructure and rheology of  suspension was studied in the simple shear flow. The concentration  profiles of spheres and rods were similar to the previous studies with  suspension of RBCs and platelets in blood flow. The average angular  velocities of the particles was observed to decrease with the increase  in the concentration of rods. This results into overall rise in the  suspension viscosity and the first normal stress difference. In the case  of the pressure driven flow a single sphere in the suspension of rods  displays margination towards the wall only at moderate concentration. On  the other hand  a rod in the suspension of spheres always migrates  towards the center of the channel. The margination and migration of  spheres in the pressure driven flow depends on its relative  concentration with respect to the rods.
